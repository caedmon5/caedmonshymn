     <head id="CH7.1.HEAD">Introduction</head>
     <p id="CH7.010" n="7.1">&ech; is a critical edition and witness archive.<note id="CH7.NOTE.010" n="1"><p>This combination of approaches is a well-established desideratum in electronic editing. See &mcgillivray1994;, &mcgann1995;, &vanhoutte1999;, and &vanhoutte2000;.</p></note> As a <socalled>critical edition,</socalled> the project presents readers with a series of explicitly evaluative representations of the poem at significant (though usually hypothetical) points in its transmission history.<note id="CH7.NOTE.020" n="2"><p>See &mcgillivray1994; for a well-balanced defence of the continuing relevance of evaluative approaches to editing in the <socalled>post-critical</socalled> age.</p></note> As a <socalled>witness archive,</socalled> the project also provides readers with more lightly mediated access, in the form of transcriptions and digital colour facsimiles, to the basic material from which the critical editions are constructed.<note id="CH7.NOTE.030" n="3"><p>The extent to which digital representations of evidence necessarily interpret the underlying material from which they have been derived is discussed in &solopova2000;, <title level="a">Guidelines for Transcription of the Manuscripts of The Wife of Bath&rsquo;s Prologue,</title> especially &sect;&nbsp;[2.1], <title level="a">The interpretative character of transcription of manuscripts for the computer.</title></p></note> In the print volume, these texts are presented in traditional form. On the accompanying CD-ROM, extensive use of cross-linking and other features peculiar to the electronic medium provide readers with a more interactive experience. References to specific language from the poem in the textual apparatus, introductory chapters, and glossary are accompanied by hyperlinks that allow the reader to navigate directly to the corresponding witness transcription. Similar links connect witness transcriptions to facsimiles of the relevant page and copy of the poem. Editions and transcriptions can be displayed in different ways depending on the nature of the information sought. Transcriptions of individual witnesses can be arranged in diplomatic form (i.e. with manuscript lineation, word-division, punctuation, and symbols recording other information about the appearance of the text in the manuscript) or with normalised spacing, and word- and line-division. Critical editions of the poem can be displayed with different types of critical apparatus and, in some cases, before or after emendation or correction.</p>
     <div3 id="CH7.1.1">
      <head id="CH7.1.1.HEAD">About the critical editions (Print and CD-ROM)</head>
      <p id="CH7.020" n="7.2">The edition side of &ech; contains eight distinct critical texts. There is one critical text for each of the poem&rsquo;s five main recensions, a critical reconstruction of the poem&rsquo;s likely Northumbrian archetype, and editions of two <socalled>scribal performances</socalled> from manuscripts of the &eorthan; (&b1x; and &ox;).</p> 
      <p id="CH7.030" n="7.3">In the print volume, these texts are presented with an apparatus showing substantive textual variation (see below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r828;); on the CD-ROM, users can alter these texts to display different types of information. The default view, the <term type="technicalterm">Reading text</term> (CD-ROM only), is an almost pure <socalled>clear text</socalled> eclectic edition of the relevant recension or witness.<note id="CH7.NOTE.040" n="4"><p>Terminology used in this discussion is based on &greetham1994;, especially Appendix II. The <socalled>Reading texts</socalled> are not pure clear text editions in that they include explicit indication of emendations supported by no manuscript authority (cf. &greetham1994;, 368). The editions are eclectic in that they are based on a copy-text but supplemented with readings from other manuscripts and modern editorial emendations when necessary.</p></note> In this view, the focus is on the poem as a literary text. The Old English is presented with modern punctuation, lineation, and word division. Links within the text take the reader to the edition&rsquo;s glossary.</p>
      <p id="CH7.040" n="7.4">The remaining views emphasise the poem&rsquo;s textual development and are <socalled>inclusive</socalled> in intent (see &greetham1994;, 368). The Old English is presented with explicit indication of editorial activity and accompanied by a textual apparatus with readings from the relevant witnesses. Links within the text and apparatus take the reader to the individual witnesses from whose testimony the edition is constructed.</p>
      <p id="CH7.050" n="7.5">These views are classified according to the level of abstraction used in grouping and displaying readings from the supporting witnesses. The least abstract view is the <term type="technicalterm">All witnesses</term> view (CD-ROM only). In this view, the textual apparatus provides a diplomatic transcription of every reading in all relevant witnesses regardless of relative similarity or difference. By reproducing the readings of all relevant witnesses, this view encourages readers to compare editorial forms against those of the underlying tradition; by reproducing these forms diplomatically, the apparatus also invites readers to consider the extent to which features of manuscript layout, such as line boundaries, word-division, and other graphic conventions may have affected the poem&rsquo;s development. Readings in this view can be displayed in <term type="technicalterm">Analytic</term> or <term type="technicalterm">Parallel</term> display. In the <term type="technicalterm">Parallel Display</term>, witness readings are presented in the same order in every apparatus entry regardless of relative similarity or difference. In the <term type="technicalterm">Analytic Display</term>, readings are grouped according to their relative similarity. The <term type="technicalterm">Parallel Display</term> view provides readers with what is in essence a parallel text transcription of the &hymn;&rsquo;s manuscript tradition; the <term type="technicalterm">Analytic Display</term> view provides readers with an explicit and synoptic account of relationships among witnesses for every reading in the edited text.<note id="CH7.NOTE.045" n="5"><p>The reconstructed text of the Northumbrian archteype has two sets of apparatus (on the CD-ROM), one collating readings from the edited recensional texts, another showing readings from all surviving witnesses. See below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r880;.</p></note></p>
      <p id="CH7.060" n="7.6">A second slightly more abstract view displays <term type="technicalterm">Orthographic variants</term> (CD-ROM only). This view ignores all differences that do not affect spelling (such as differences in spacing, manuscript line division, or variant forms of graphemes). Manuscript readings are displayed using normalised word spacing and division, and forms showing identical spellings are grouped together (e.g. &referenceTot1.1b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1b.1;</mentioned> &referenceTob1.1b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1b.1;</mentioned> &referenceToca.1b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfca.1b.1;</mentioned> and &referenceTohr.1b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfhr.1b.1;</mentioned> are grouped together under <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">heofonrices</mentioned>, 1b, in the apparatus to the <term type="technicalterm">Orthographic witness variants</term> view of the &original;). Sigla are used to indicate agreement among individual witnesses. Manuscripts not mentioned explicitly in a given apparatus entry show the same spelling as the editorial lemma.</p>
      <p id="CH7.070" n="7.7">A third level of abstraction is represented in the <term type="technicalterm">Substantive variants</term> view (Print and CD-ROM). This view groups witnesses according to their impact on sense, metre, or syntax. <socalled>Impact</socalled> in this case is mechanically determined: for the purposes of this edition, substantive variants include all forms that affect sense, metre, or syntax in any way, regardless of origin or intention. Examples thus include contextually appropriate alternatives (e.g. &referenceTot1.3a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.3a.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTob1.3a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3a.2;</mentioned>; &referenceTom.6a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6a.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTol.6a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.6a.2;</mentioned>; &referenceTot1.5a.3; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.5a.3;</mentioned> : &referenceToo.5a.3; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.5a.3;</mentioned>; &referenceTot1.1a.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1a.1;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1a.2;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1a.3;</mentioned> : &referenceTob1.1a.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.1;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.2;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.3;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.4;</mentioned>), contextually inappropriate alternatives and nonsense forms (e.g. &referenceToh.4b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.4b.1;</mentioned> : &referenceTow.4b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfw.4b.1;</mentioned> : &referenceToto.4b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfto.4b.1;</mentioned>; &referenceToh.9b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.9b.1;</mentioned> : &referenceTotr.9b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOftr.9b.1;</mentioned>), alternative spellings that can be construed as affecting metre (e.g. &referenceTom.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.4b.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTodi.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfdi.4b.2;</mentioned>), and minor and obvious scribal errors (e.g. &referenceToh.1a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.1a.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTodi.1a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfdi.1a.2;</mentioned>). Orthographic variants that do not affect sense, metre, or syntax are silently grouped together under a single headword (e.g. &referenceToh.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.4b.2;</mentioned> and &referenceTodi.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfdi.4b.2;</mentioned> are grouped together under <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfeo.4b.2;</mentioned> in the <term type="technicalterm">Substantive witness variants</term> view of the &original;). Sigla are used to indicate substantive agreement among individual witnesses. Manuscripts not mentioned explicitly in a given apparatus entry are substantively identical to the editorial lemma.</p>
      <p id="CH7.080" n="7.8">The fourth level of abstraction is represented in the <term type="technicalterm">(Potentially) significant variants</term> view (CD-ROM only). In this view, apparatus entries include only those forms that might be understood as involving a change in metrical, lexical or syntactic <socalled>significance</socalled> from the editorial lemma: i.e. variation involving the substitution of one lexical form, metrical pattern,<note id="CH7.NOTE.050" n="6"><p>Metrical patterns are assumed to be <socalled>significantly</socalled> different when the variation alters the type or subtype to which a pattern belongs in Siever&rsquo;s system. In most cases, this excludes variation between resolved and unresolved lifts, but includes variation between short and long lifts. This is an imperfect distinction, since resolution does at times appear to be statistically significant (see in particular, &hutcheson1995;, 396). Variation between resolved and unresolved forms is, however, quite common in the general corpus of multiply attested Old English poetry. See &odonnell1996a; for a discussion of variation in the corpus.</p></note> or syntactic construction for another, or the irreversible destruction of sense, metre, or syntax. Such substitutions include variation between contextually appropriate alternatives (e.g. &referenceTot1.3a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.3a.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTob1.3a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3a.2;</mentioned>; &referenceTom.6a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6a.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTol.6a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.6a.2;</mentioned>; &referenceTot1.5a.3; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.5a.3;</mentioned> : &referenceToo.5a.3; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.5a.3;</mentioned>; &referenceTot1.1a.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1a.1;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1a.2;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.1a.3;</mentioned> : &referenceTob1.1a.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.1;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.2;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.3;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.4;</mentioned>) and contextually inappropriate alternatives and nonsense forms that cannot easily be restored to the archetypal form (e.g. &referenceToh.4b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.4b.1;</mentioned> : &referenceTow.4b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfw.4b.1;</mentioned> : &referenceToto.4b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfto.4b.1;</mentioned>; &referenceToh.9b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.9b.1;</mentioned> : &referenceTotr.9b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOftr.9b.1;</mentioned>). They exclude, however, minor and obvious errors or alternative spellings of what can reasonably be considered as variant forms of the lemma, even if these have a minor effect on sense or metre (e.g. &referenceTom.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.4b.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTodi.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfdi.4b.2;</mentioned>; &referenceToh.1a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfh.1a.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTodi.1a.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfdi.1a.2;</mentioned>). Variants that are not (potentially) significant are grouped together silently under a single headword (e.g. &referenceTom.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.4b.2;</mentioned> : &referenceTodi.4b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfdi.4b.2;</mentioned> are grouped together in the <term type="technicalterm">Significant witness variants</term> view of the apparatus to the &original;). Sigla are used to indicate agreement among individual witnesses. Manuscripts not mentioned explicitly in a given apparatus entry are not significantly different from the editorial lemma.</p>
      <p id="CH7.090" n="7.9">In classifying variants as <term type="technicalterm">Orthographic</term>, <term type="technicalterm">Substantive</term>, or <term type="technicalterm">(Potentially) significant</term>, I have applied the above criteria more rigorously in the case of early witnesses than late, and in the case of Anglo-Saxon scribes than continental. Thus &referenceTom.6b.2; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6b.2;</mentioned> (for expected <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.6b.2;</mentioned>) is treated as potentially significant, even though it can be explained relatively easily as a scribal error, because it could be understood as involving a change in meaning (see below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r110;) and because the variant is in the hand of an eighth-century scribe (&ch4xAppendix;). &referenceTosm.2b.1; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfsm.2b.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.2b.1;</mentioned>, on the other hand, is treated as substantive rather than (potentially) significant, because the error involves a fairly obvious misconstruction of an <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">e&plus;t</seg> ligature as <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&aelig;</seg> and because it is in the hand of a fifteenth-century scribe prone to making such mistakes. The &eordu;, finally, represents a distinct case. All three witnesses to this recension are in continental hands, and, as I argue below (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r160;-&ch7r200;), are probably derived from the same insular exemplar. No scribe shows any evidence to suggest that he understood what he was copying. In the apparatus associated with the edition of this recension, therefore, variants are classified as either <socalled>accidental</socalled> or <socalled>substantive</socalled> on the basis of their significance for the filiation of the surviving witnesses.</p>

       <p id="CH7.150" n="7.14">This edition attempts to reconstruct the original text of &ch; as it is implied by the evidence of the surviving manuscripts. This text may or may not be the same as that sung by C&aelig;dmon in response to his dream visitor (assuming Bede&rsquo;s version of the story is at least broadly correct in its discussion of the circumstances under which the Whitby herdsman became a poet, see &ch1x;); it should, however, correspond in its substantive details with what seems to have been the single written archetype that ultimately underlies all known copies of the &hymn; (see &ch5x;, above; cf. &cavill2000;, esp. 525-530).<note id="CH7.NOTE.055" n="7"><p>In arguing that versions of the &hymn; with <quote><mentioned lang="ANG">eordu-eor&eth;an</mentioned>... might... reflect an oral text which has undergone slight garbling in the process of transmission</quote> (525), &cavill2000; revives a suggestion first made in &zupitza1878;, who was writing before the discovery of the &eordu; and the development of contemporary oral theory. Cavill&rsquo;s claim that this makes the question of <quote><foreign lang="LAT">lectio difficilior</foreign>... redundant, because there is no <foreign>lectio</foreign></quote> is disingenuous, however. Whether we assume the transmission was <socalled>oral</socalled> or <socalled>literate,</socalled> we are still left with the problem of explaining how a significantly &difficilior; variant might arise in the course of the &hymn;&rsquo;s dissemination. All current theories of <socalled>oral</socalled> transmission would predict the opposite pattern of substitution, i.e. from the nonce&mdash;and hence &difficilior;&mdash;collocation <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.5b.1; &copyOfno.5b.2;</mentioned> to the relatively well attested&mdash;and hence &facilior;&mdash;formula <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfae.5b.1; &copyOfae.5b.2;</mentioned>. See, for example, the discussion of the <quote>disappointed scribal expectations</quote> (&okeeffe1990;, 95) which lead to the substitution of the formulaic <mentioned lang="ANG">eor&eth;bugendum</mentioned> for nonce <mentioned lang="ANG">iegbugendum</mentioned> in the &tr1x; copy of &CPPref; (&okeeffe1990;, 93). Memorial transmission, likewise, Jabbour notes, has a documented tendency <quote>to convert the specific to the general, the individualized to the stylized; aberrations in either style or conception... into forms more nearly central to the tradition</quote> (&jabbour1968;, 43).</p></note> It is probably impossible to recover the exact spellings used in this archetype with certainty; for reasons discussed below (&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r130;), accidental details of orthography are for the most part based on &mx; and, when the relevant form is not found in that manuscript, the reconstructed form of the archetype of the &eordu;.</p>
       <p id="CH7.160" n="7.15">As far as I am aware, this is the first modern edition of &ch; to be based on a critical evaluation of the entire surviving manuscript tradition. Although the &hymn;&rsquo;s filiation and textual transmission has been studied frequently since the discovery of the &eordu; by Wuest in 1906, no scholar appears to have attempted the critical reconstruction of the archetypal &hymn; that much of this research implies. Most scholarly and student-oriented editions of the poem are <socalled>best-text</socalled> or single-witness (e.g. &fulkandpope2001;; &mitchellandrobinsonfc2001;); a few other editions, most notably &wuest1906;, &smithah1978;, and &odonnell1996b;, provide critical texts of individual recensions. Even Dobbie, who undertook his seminal investigation into the &hymn;&rsquo;s transmission as a <foreign lang="ELL">prolegomenon</foreign> to his edition of the poem in the &aspr; (&dobbie1942;) and whose work on the text is among the most cited of modern discussions, appears to have ignored several of his own most significant conclusions about the poem in his subsequent edition. The decision to group witnesses of the poem by dialect, for example, contradicts Dobbie&rsquo;s earlier conclusion that dialect was an insignificant factor in the poem&rsquo;s textual development<note id="CH7.NOTE.060" n="8"><p>&dobbie1937;, 45-48, esp. 46, 47 and the illustration on 48; this same view is reflected in the introduction to &dobbie1942;, despite its lack of realisation in the accompanying text. See &dobbie1942;, xcvii-xcviii.</p></note> and causes him to group together manuscripts that he had previously argued came from different textual branches.<note id="CH7.NOTE.070" n="9"><p>There are strong reasons for questioning Dobbie&rsquo;s original view of the &hymn;&rsquo;s textual transmission; an alternative explanation is proposed above, &ch5x;.</p></note></p>

       <p id="CH7.170" n="7.16">The reconstructed text of the archetypal &ch; in this edition follows the conventions outlined above, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r820;-&ch7r829;. Unlike editions of the five main recensions, however, the archetypal text comes on the CD-ROM with two sets of textual apparatus (the print text uses the default apparatus). The default (recensional) apparatus collates the text of the &hymn; against that of the five main recensions. This view emphasises the textual development of the &hymn; as a whole while ignoring minor, recension-internal differences among witnesses to any given version of the poem; it corresponds in this regard largely with the approach to the &hymn;&rsquo;s textual development taken in &ch5x;, above. The alternative (witness) apparatus compares the reconstructed text against transcriptions of all known witnesses without regard for their recensional affiliation. This view emphasises local agreement and disagreement among the &hymn;&rsquo;s many witnesses over the poem&rsquo;s recensional development. It should be of interest to readers who are interested in tracing the history and popularity of specific forms, who are looking for information about the copying habits of individual scribes, or who wish to test the editor&rsquo;s conclusions concerning the most likely reconstruction. Both apparatus can be further altered on the CD-ROM to display the four standard levels of abstraction discussed above: an <term type="technicalterm">all witnesses</term> view, to display readings from all relevant witnesses or recensions; an <term type="technicalterm">accidental variants</term> view, to show non-orthographic differences; a <term type="technicalterm">substantive variants</term> view, to reveal variation that affects sense, syntax, or metre; and a <term type="technicalterm">significant variants</term> view, to show variants that have a (potentially) significant effect on sense, metre, or syntax. The <term type="technicalterm">parallel all witness view,</term> finally, can be used to construct a parallel text edition of all surviving witnesses or recensions of the poem.</p>

One other eighth-century English manuscript of the <label rend="oblique">m</label>-text is known, the partially destroyed &tiba14ml; (&tiba14s;). A fourth, now lost, copy can be deduced from the evidence of three ninth-century German and French manuscripts: &wolfenbuttelml; (&wolfenbuttels;), &wurzburgml; (&wurzburgs;), and &namurml; (&namurs;) and a fifth perhaps from the evidence of a dozen twelfth-century continental manuscripts (&colgraveandmynors1969;, xliv-xlv and lxviii-lxix). All other English copies of the &historia; contain the <label rend="oblique">c</label>-text. Among the early <label rend="oblique">m</label>-type recension manuscripts, only &mx; and &lx; contain a copy of the Old English &hymn;.</p>
	<p id="CH7.200" n="7.19">The precise relationship of these early English manuscripts of the &he; to each other and their common archetype is unknown. &lx; shows a particularly close affinity in several details to &tiba14s;, suggesting either direct filial descent or a close fraternal relationship (see &fulk1992;, 426). &mx;, for its part, is close to &lx; and &tiba14s; in substance, but shows numerous minor differences usually attributed to the haste with which the scribe appears to have worked. In the textual introduction to the EEMF facsimile of the manuscript (&hunterblair1959;), Mynors concludes that &mx; and &lx; are independent copies of <quote id="CH7.QUOTE.0020">the same very early and authentic parent text</quote> (33; also &colgraveandmynors1969;, xxxix-xl and xliv).

	<p id="CH7.220" n="7.21">As is true of the host manuscripts&rsquo; Latin text, the witnesses to the Old English poem in &mx; and &lx; appear to be fraternally rather than filially related (as noted above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r050;, neither &tiba14s; nor the exemplars implied by &wolfenbuttels;, &wurzburgs;, &namurs;, or the twelfth-century continental texts appear to have contained a copy of the vernacular &hymn;).

	<p id="CH7.230" n="7.22">Although the &hymn; appears to have been copied by a scribe of the main Latin text of the &he; in both &mx; and &lx;, this does not necessarily imply that the scribes responsible found their texts of the &hymn; and the &historia; in the same exemplar.

As mentioned below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch4x520;, this location suggests that the scribe may have collected this material from the margins of a different exemplar. As Anderson has demonstrated, moreover, the orthography of the Old English &hymn; in &mx; differs in several regards from the scribe&rsquo;s usual practice in recording Old English place and personal names in the main text of the &he;, again suggesting that the vernacular poem and main Latin text of the &historia; may have come from different exemplars (&arngart1941;, 143 [&sect;&nbsp;7.iii] and 144 [&sect;&nbsp;2], 145).</p>

The two witnesses are at the same time too different to be understood as mere copies of a common exemplar and too similar to warrant a parallel text edition. With neither version having an obvious claim to priority, an editor has little textual reason for preferring the readings of one version above those of the other.</p>
       <p id="CH7.250" n="7.24">The variants themselves do not help decide the issue. Each manuscript shows one relatively certain mistake. &lx; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.5b.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfae.5b.1;</mentioned>, 5b, shows what is probably a confusion of <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">u</seg> and open-headed <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">a</seg> in the inflectional ending. Similar errors are found throughout the main text of the Latin &he; in &lx;, though they are relatively less common in the stint of Scribe D (the scribe responsible for copying &ch;) than in those of the other three main-text scribes (&parkes1982;, 7). &mx; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6b.2;</mentioned>, 6b, shows what is probably a mistake for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.6b.2;</mentioned> with assimilation of the final -<seg type="linguistic" subtype="phonemic">nd</seg> and graphic simplification of the medial -<seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">pp</seg>- (&odonnell1996a;, 53-54). A partial parallel can be found in Psalm 50, 46, <mentioned lang="ANG">sceppen</mentioned>, and &Beo;, 106a, where <mentioned lang="ANG">scyppen</mentioned> has been corrected to <mentioned lang="ANG">scyppend</mentioned> with the addition of a final <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">d</seg> above the line. The other possibility, that the &mx; reading is the only recorded survival of an Old English cognate for WGmc <mentioned lang="GEM-PR">skapinaz</mentioned> (cf.

       <p id="CH7.260" n="7.25">&mx; and &lx; do differ in two sensible readings that are also syntactically and metrically appropriate: &lx; <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.2b.1;</mentioned> : &mx; <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.2b.1;</mentioned>, 2b, and &lx; <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.6a.2;</mentioned> : &mx; <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6a.2;</mentioned>, 6a. Here too, however, there is little reason to prefer one form over the other. In the case of <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.2b.1;</mentioned> : <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.2b.1;</mentioned>, it is probably impossible to determine priority: the two readings are exact synonyms and cognates (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch6x14;): either could be the archetypal form. In that of <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.6a.2;</mentioned> : <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6a.2;</mentioned>, neither reading is obviously more or less likely to represent an innovation. On the one hand, the  &lx; reading <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.6a.2;</mentioned> is common to all other copies of &ch; and more common in the Old English corpus at large&mdash;it is easy to see how a scribe, faced with the statistically rare form <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6a.2;</mentioned>, might consciously or unconsciously substitute the more common <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.6a.2;</mentioned>; on the other hand, however, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6a.2;</mentioned> is a Northumbrian word and &mx; and &lx; are both Northumbrian manuscripts: it is also easy to see how a Northumbrian scribe working in haste might have substituted a familiar dialectal form for its exact synonym.</p>
       <p id="CH7.270" n="7.26">All previous editions of the &aelda; have taken &mx; as their base (&fulkandpope2001;; &smithah1978;; &dobbie1942;).<note id="CH7.NOTE.100" n="11"><p>&fulkandpope2001; and &smithah1978; are best-text editions. &dobbie1942; takes &mx; as the base for his composite text of the <socalled>Northumbrian Version.</socalled> See above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r870;.</p></note> In doing so, these editors appear to have been swayed by two main criteria: a now untenable belief, based on the so-called <socalled>Moore Memoranda,</socalled> that &mx; was certainly the older of the two manuscripts (see &ch4xAppendix;, below), and the observation that &mx; contains a slightly greater preponderance of rare dialectal spellings in its copy of the &hymn; (see &anderson1941;, 143-145). While contemporary scholarship is now less certain that &mx; represents the earlier manuscript, the linguistic interest of the forms in this manuscript remains a legitimate ground for preferring the &mx; text.

In the case of <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.2b.1;</mentioned> : <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.2b.1;</mentioned> this is because the two forms are such close cognates; in that of <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.5b.1;</mentioned> : <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.5b.1;</mentioned>, it is because of the frequency with which <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">a</seg> and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">u</seg> are confused in &lx;.</p>

Colgrave and Mynors, who do not appear to have been aware of the presence of the Old English &hymn; in any of these manuscripts, assigned them to different branches of the &historia;&rsquo;s transmission. &brx; and &p1x;, for which they collated selected passages of the Latin text, they assigned to the <socalled>German</socalled> <label rend="oblique">m</label>-type recension; &dix;, which they did not examine, they tentatively assigned to the <socalled>English</socalled> <label rend="oblique">c</label>-type text, presumably on the basis of the strong English focus of its contents (&colgraveandmynors1969;, lxv-lxvi, lxi).</p>
	<p id="CH7.310" n="7.30">This last filiation, however, is almost certainly wrong (&odonnell1996b;, 151-159).

With the exception of the Old English translation of the &he; (which always contains the &eorthan;), no single recension of the &he; is characterised by the presence of a particular text of the vernacular &hymn;.</p></note> &dix; shows a number of features that suggest that it is closer to &p1x; and &brx; than members of the <socalled>English</socalled> tradition. The manuscript is written in a mixture of English and continental hands, has a first person plural reference to the monastery at C&icirc;teaux, and includes a version of Bede&rsquo;s prose <title level="m">Vita Cuthberti</title> that is otherwise found only in continental, indeed, primarily Cistercian, manuscripts (see &colgrave1940;, 49, where the manuscript is assigned the siglum Dj1).<note id="CH7.NOTE.120" n="13"><p>&dix; is unique in combining a complete copy of the &historia; with the prose Life.

Although given the necessarily selective nature of the collations used by editors of the &he;, it is impossible to say how many other copies of the <socalled>German</socalled> recension contained this error, the mistake does not appear to go back to the earliest exemplars&mdash;neither Colgrave and Mynors nor Plummer (who used a full collation of &namurs; and partial collations of other members of the <socalled>German</socalled> family in establishing his text) mention the variant in their critical apparatus (ed. &colgraveandmynors1969;, 416, and ed. &plummer1975;, 1: 259-260).</p>

	<p id="CH7.340" n="7.33">These similarities and differences suggest the following stemma for the transmission of the &hymn;, and to the extent that the anomalies in the placement of <mentioned lang="LAT">miraculorum</mentioned> and the insertion of the Old English poem in the main Latin text are evidence of a common exemplar, the Latin &he;:</p>

	<p rend="noindent">Since none of the variant readings that divide witnesses to the &eordu; involves sensible, metrically acceptable, and syntactically appropriate alternatives, it seems likely that the text of the &hymn; in all three manuscripts goes back to a single copy, imported to the continent sometime before the twelfth century (&odonnell1996b;, 155-159). This copy may or may not have been found in the same insular manuscript as that responsible for the Latin text of the &he; in all three manuscripts. The vernacular &hymn; often travels independently of Bede&rsquo;s Latin, and, as the use of a copy of the &eorthan; to gloss the Latin &historia; in the perhaps continental &tox; demonstrates, scribes could freely borrow texts of the poem from manuscripts containing other recensions of the &he;. At the same time, however, the poor knowledge of Old English shown by these scribes suggests that none were responsible for adding the vernacular poem to the main text of the &he; in this tradition.</p>

       <p id="CH7.350" n="7.34">The &eordu; of &ch; is the most frequently edited text of the poem. It is, indeed, the only version to have been the subject of more than one critical edition of the manuscript tradition (&odonnell1996b;; &dobbie1937;, 21; &wuest1906;). In each case, the editorial approach has been explicitly reconstructive. This edition follows the lead of these earlier editions in that its focus remains the reconstruction of the &eordu;&rsquo;s archetypal insular text (scholars interested in the recension as a case study in the transmission of Old English texts by continental scribes or as raw evidence for linguistic study of Northumbrian will almost certainly prefer to work directly with the facsimiles and diplomatic transcriptions collected in the witness archive). The main difference between this edition and previous critical texts lies in the amount of evidence available. With the identification of &brx; as a third witness to the &eordu; (&odonnell1996b;), scholars are now in a better position to assess the evidence of the two better known witnesses, &p1x; and &dix;.</p>
       <p id="CH7.360" n="7.35">In most cases, discovering the underlying form is a relatively straightforward task.

       <p rend="noindent">While the substantive readings these forms reflect is beyond doubt in each case, the precise spellings are somewhat more open to debate.

In this manuscript, the equivalent form in &brx; has a small cross-like smudge above the vowel. Taken with the macron in &p1x;, this suggests that at least one common ancestor of these two manuscripts had some kind of elevated mark above the <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">a</seg>. That the mark was not a suspension or accent mark (indicating, for example, an original in <mentioned lang="ANG">dam</mentioned>) is suggested by the form in &brx;. Suspension marks are the most common mark of abbreviation in Latin manuscripts: a continental scribe faced with an unknown form ending in <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&amacr;</seg> or <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&aacute;</seg> would almost certainly understand the accent as a Latin suspension. If the original version of the poem had an insular  <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&eth;</seg> with rounded back and a prominent cross stroke, however, the same scribe might well understand the top of this character as looking something like a cross (&brx;) or a badly formed suspension mark (&p1x;; see &odonnell1996b;, 157-159; &cavill2000;, 513).</p>

If the form does point back to an original in <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&eth;</seg>, however, then it seems more likely that the continental scribe responsible for the current form has misunderstood the cross stroke of the original <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&eth;</seg> as an <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">e&plus;a</seg> ligature rather than the <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">d&plus;e</seg> combination Wuest suggests.

This is because the &ylda; has been transmitted with a remarkably high degree of substantive accuracy. In the course of four centuries, the scribes responsible for copying this version of the poem introduce only one potentially sensible textual variant: the substitution of the marginally sensible and metrically problematic <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfw.4b.1;</mentioned> in the mid-eleventh-century &wx; for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.4b.1;</mentioned>, 4b, in all other witness. All other variants in the poem are either nonsensical or the result of obvious error or accidental differences in orthography. These variants are distributed apparently at random, moreover: every copy of the text shows at least one unique reading and no pre-fourteenth-century manuscripts appear to share diverging forms on any regular basis. While a more regular pattern can be seen in the innovations found in the recension&rsquo;s fourteenth- and fifteenth-century witnesses, &tr1x; and &sanmx;, the common variants here are also better understood as coincidental variation rather than evidence of a close genetic relationship: both witnesses contain mistakes not found in the other text and the variants they share, like the variants in which they differ, tend to belong to the most common sort of errors introduced by scribes of late manuscripts: confusion of <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&wynn;</seg> and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">p</seg>, of <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">t</seg> and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">c</seg>, and, in &tr1x; in particular, <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">f</seg> and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">p</seg>.</p>
	<p id="CH7.480" n="7.47">The substantive accuracy with which the &ylda; has been transmitted is all the more remarkable considering the state of its text.

	<p id="CH7.490" n="7.48">Of these, the most serious corruption is the use of <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.8b.2;</mentioned> in place of the expected verb. In most versions of the Old English poem, 7 through 9 form a separate clause:</p>

	<p id="CH7.500" n="7.49">As Dobbie suggests, most of the errors in this recension can be attributed to the apparent misapprehension of Northern spellings by the poem&rsquo;s original West-Saxon translator.

As &orton1998; has suggested, this reading is probably best explained as a misunderstanding of a Northumbrian weak accusative singular in -<seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">a</seg> or -<seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">u</seg> (156), although dittography of the dative plural ending on <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.9a.1;</mentioned> cannot be ruled out. The reading <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.7a.1;</mentioned> (for expected <mentioned lang="ANG">&thorn;a middangeard</mentioned>), in 7a, finally, appears to represent an attempt at limiting the syntactical damage caused by the substitution of <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.8b.2;</mentioned> for <mentioned lang="ANG">teode</mentioned> in 8b: as &odonnell1996a; suggests, the change in case (from accusative to dative) and the metrically necessary omission of the adverb <mentioned lang="ANG">&eth;a</mentioned> allows 7a to be construed as part of the preceding clause: in the &ylda;, <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.7a.1;</mentioned> is a dative of advantage or reference approximately parallel to <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.5b.1;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="preemendation" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0180" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.5b.2;</mentioned> in 5b: <gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0180">He, the holy creator, first made heaven as a roof for the children of men, for the earth...</gloss> (21-32, esp. 29-30; trans. &orton1998;, 156, where a similar point is made). In all other versions of the text, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.7a.2;</mentioned> is an accusative singular object for <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0190" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.8b.2;</mentioned> in 8b, <gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0190">then the guardian of mankind, the eternal lord, the holy architect, the almighty ruler, appointed the middle earth, the nations, for men of earth</gloss> (trans. based on the readings of the &eorthan;; the &neordu; and &wseorthe; recensions show other differences unrelated to the variant in question).</p>
	<p id="CH7.510" n="7.50">The only unique form common to all manuscripts of the &ylda; that cannot be explained easily as the result of an original error in the interpretation of Northern spellings when the recension was first translated into West-Saxon is the substitution <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.4;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned lang="ANG">geh&wynn;&aelig;s</mentioned> in 3b. It is possible that the form is a performance variant&mdash;<mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.4;</mentioned> is syntactically appropriate, does not damage metre, and, understood as an appositive variation on <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.4b.1;</mentioned>, makes reasonable sense in context: instead of a genitive governed by <mentioned rend="preemendation" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0200" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.4b.1;</mentioned> in 5b as in most other versions of the poem (<gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0200">[he] appointed the beginning of each of wonders</gloss>), the presumably accusative <mentioned rend="preemendation" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0210" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.4;</mentioned> must instead be read as being syntactically parallel to <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.4b.1;</mentioned> (<gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0210">[he] appointed the beginning, each of wonders</gloss>). On the other hand, however, the collocation <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.3;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.4;</mentioned> does not appear to be formulaic and may have its origins in a graphic mistake: in insular script, the two forms show a slight resemblance to each other.

On the one hand, few of this recension&rsquo;s innovative forms can be regarded reasonably as anything but mistakes: in all four places in which all witnesses to the &ylda; preserve a unique form found in no other version of the text, the &yldaShortReference; reading is clearly inferior and can be explained by an appeal to relatively straightforward translation errors or the misapprehension of specific letters and forms. Even the sole potentially sensible variant in the recension&rsquo;s internal history, &wx; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfw.4b.1;</mentioned>, 4b, for <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.4b.1;</mentioned> in all other manuscripts, is better understood as a result of scribal carelessness than formulaic acuity on the part of a scribe who makes a number of similar errors (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r330;). If this is a scribal <socalled>performance,</socalled> it is of a markedly inferior type to that produced in the highly innovative, but usually metrically and syntactically appropriate, &b1x; witness to the &eorthan; (see below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r510;).</p>
       <p id="CH7.530" n="7.52">On the other hand, however, it seems equally clear that the surviving witnesses by-and-large represent both the original state of the recension&rsquo;s text, and a version that was read and apparently accepted without significant correction by scribes working over a period of four hundred years. Since most of the shared errors in this recension appear to go back to the original translation from Northumbrian into West-Saxon, an idealised, corrected, edition of the poem would produce a text that may never have existed in Anglo-Saxon England, and one that differs significantly from that copied by scribes who, in the eleventh and early twelfth centuries, at least, might still be assumed to have understood their native poetry. As flawed as it is, the unemended consensus text implied by the &yldaShortReference; witnesses is, in this sense, a scribally authorised and accurately preserved copy of an Old English poem.</p>
       <p id="CH7.540" n="7.53">This edition attempts to negotiate these competing interests by allowing readers to choose between emended and unemended views of the poem.

This version replaces the nonsensical forms <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.7a.1;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.8b.2;</mentioned>, and <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.9a.3;</mentioned> in 7a, 8b, and 9a with <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.7a.1;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.8b.2;</mentioned>, and <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.9a.3;</mentioned> respectively, but leaves <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.4;</mentioned> uncorrected, both because the variant is less obviously the result of a direct translation error, and because it does make some sense, syntax, and metre. This corrected version of the poem should be of interest to all who are interested in the recension as an Old English literary text (i.e. for literary enjoyment, learning Old English, metrical studies, and even, to the extent that the recension provides evidence useful in the reconstruction of the &hymn;&rsquo;s textual transmission, textual criticism).</p>
       <p id="CH7.550" n="7.54">The alternative view (CD-ROM only) attempts to reconstruct the original (apparently corrupt) text that seems to have been responsible for all subsequent copies. This version is less likely to be of intrinsic interest to general readers, though it may prove of interest to those studying Anglo-Saxon scribal practice.</p>

       <p id="CH7.560" n="7.55">The critical text and apparatus of the &ylda; follows the conventions outlined above, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r824;-&ch7r829;. As mentioned above (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r350;-&ch7r360;), the &ylda;, in its unemended form, implies a different understanding of the syntax of 5 through 9. For this reason, the two critical texts have different punctuation. The unemended view of the text shows the punctuation implied by the syntax of the surviving witnesses; the altered punctuation required by the emended text is itself treated as an emendation and indicated using square brackets. For orthographic and substantive variants, the divisions are straightforward and relatively mechanical. Accidental variants involve all differences in orthography that do not appear to affect metre, sense, or syntax. Substantive variants, here as elsewhere in this edition, are defined as all verbal differences between witnesses that do have an effect on sense, metre, or syntax, no matter how small. Significant variants need to be defined on a case by case basis. In this case, they include all substantive differences that cannot be explained as the result of an obvious scribal error. Thus the &wx; variant <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfw.4b.1;</mentioned> in 4a is included as a potentially significant variant because it is found in a relatively early manuscript and makes (some) sense. The &sanmx; variant <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfsm.2b.1;</mentioned> for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&tyronianNota;</mentioned> in 2b, on the other hand, is excluded from this list because it makes no sense and has an obvious scribal origin in the substitution <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&aelig;</seg> for the <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">e&plus;t</seg> ligature. The &tr1x; variant <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOftr.9b.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.9b.1;</mentioned>, 9b, finally, is significant. Although it is found in a late manuscript and, as far as I am aware, is nonsensical, the connection between the expected and variant forms seems surprising enough to warrant inclusion. Readers who disagree with these decisions may prefer to work from the more mechanically determined <socalled>substantive</socalled> view.</p>

Two of these manuscripts, &cx; and &tox;, have been seriously damaged or destroyed in the modern era (see above, &ch4x;).

In &tox;, as in all other witnesses to the &hymn; in manuscripts of the Latin &historia; except &mx;, the text of the vernacular poem appears on the same page as Bede&rsquo;s Latin &paraphrase;. In manuscripts of the Old English &historia;, the text of the vernacular &hymn; of necessity has been copied by a hand of the manuscript&rsquo;s principal text. In &tox;, the &hymn; was copied in a hand that may or may not be the same as that of the main Latin text: while the Latin and Old English show some similarities, differences in style of script and the reduced size of the facsimile make final conclusions difficult to draw (see &ch4xto;).</p>

	<p id="CH7.590" n="7.57">Since the early eighteenth century, manuscripts of the Old English &historia; have been divided into two main textual groups: one consisting of &t1x; and &b1x;; the second containing &cx; (as represented by &nx;), &ox; and &cax;.<note id="CH7.NOTE.190" n="20"><p>See &grant1989;, 5-7; &whitelock1963;, 81, n. 22; &miller1890;, 1:  xxiv-xxvi; &schipper1897-1899;, 2: xi-xxxv. For a modified view of this traditional division, see &grant1989;, 6. This modified stemma does not affect the following discussion: it still assumes that &cx; &ox; and &cax; belong to a common tradition and that &t1x; and &b1x; are closer to each other than to the other three copies of the Old English &he;.</p></note> The two oldest manuscripts in each tradition, &t1x; and &cx;, appear to have contained relatively similar texts.<note id="CH7.NOTE.200" n="21"><p>See &miller1890;, 1: xxv.</p></note> Among the descendants, the members of the &cx;/&nx;-&ox;-&cax; group show the least internal variation, especially in the case of &ox; and &cax; which are particularly close and probably linearly related.<note id="CH7.NOTE.210" n="22"><p>&schipper1897-1899;, 2: xix. Both Dobbie and Schipper cite Julius Zupitza <title level="m">Altenglisches &Uuml;bungsbuch</title>, 2nd edition [Vienna: 1881] iv) as the first to notice this relationship (&dobbie1937;, 213; Schipper 1898-1899, xix). I have been unable to find a record of this text.</p></note> &t1x; and &b1x;, on the other hand, show far more internal variation. While they share a number of common errors and omissions, the text of &b1x; in particular has been freely handled and contains many unique readings not found in any other manuscript of the Old English &historia;.</p>

	 <p id="CH7.600" n="7.58">As one might expect given the location of the poem in the main text of these manuscripts, the &hymn; shows a similar textual division. As is true of the framing text in the manuscripts, the Old English &hymn; in &t1x; and &cx; (as represented by &nx;) appears to have shown little variation. Although the two copies of the &hymn; are separated by five substantive variants, four of these involve obvious scribal errors in &cx;/&nx;: <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.1a.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.1a.1;</mentioned>, 1a; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.5b.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.5b.1;</mentioned>, 5b; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.8b.2;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.8b.2;</mentioned>, 8b, and <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.9a.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.9a.1;</mentioned>, 9a. Since none of these errors are found in &ox; or &cax;, manuscripts that are otherwise quite conservative in the text they transmit, they are perhaps best attributed to Nowell, &nx;&rsquo;s sixteenth-century copyist (see also &okeeffe1990;, 39). The fifth innovative form in this manuscript, <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.3a.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.3a.1;</mentioned>, 3a, however, is reflected in readings of &ox; and &cax;, and, as a result, can be used to characterise the entire &cx;/&nx;-&ox;-&cax; branch.</p>

While copies of the &hymn; at the farthest reaches of this branch differ from each other considerably, the variants which separate them can, with only two exceptions, be traced to either the nonsensical and possibly sixteenth-century errors in &cx;/&nx; or corrections in &ox;. In its uncorrected state, &ox; has only three readings (apart from expected forms for the possible transcription errors in &cx;/&nx;) which are not found in the earlier manuscript: a substitution of the approximate synonym <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned> (corrected from <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned>) for &cx;/&nx; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.3a.1;</mentioned>, 3a; the addition of the prefix <mentioned lang="ANG">ge</mentioned>- to &cx;/&nx; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.5a.3;</mentioned> (&ox; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.5a.3;</mentioned>), 5a; and the inflectional difference, <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.9a.2;</mentioned> (corrected to <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.9a.2;</mentioned>) for &cx;/&nx; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.9a.2;</mentioned>, 9a. In its corrected state, &ox; supplies all but one of the readings in &cax;.

	 <p id="CH7.630" n="7.61">These differences can be explained by an appeal to the circumstances in which each text of the vernacular poem was copied. &b1x;, which differs from &t1x; in seven readings and from &tox; in six, is, in keeping with its framing text, by far the most innovative copy of any witness to the Old English &hymn;. The seven variants it shows with &t1x; are all metrically appropriate and make at least some sense and syntax. In three cases, its <socalled>innovations</socalled> introduce readings shared with the &ylda; of the &hymn;. They are, as a result, perhaps to be attributed to conscious or unconscious contamination (that this is likely is suggested by &ox;, which also shows all three of these innovations, in two cases by correction). The remaining four variants, however, are both unique to &b1x; and metrically, syntactically, lexically, or visually far more striking.<note id="CH7.NOTE.240" n="23"><p>See &jabbour1968;, 70, for a discussion of such <socalled>striking</socalled> variants.</p></note> The inversion in &b1x; of <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.3;</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.4;</mentioned> in 1a, for example, has no significant effect on sense and little on syntax, but changes the metre to a Type B-1 from the Type A-3 line found in all other manuscripts of the &hymn;. The substitution of the relative marker <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.7a.1;</mentioned> in &b1x; for the temporal adverb <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.7a.1;</mentioned>, 7a, in the other manuscripts of the &eorthan;, in contrast, has no effect on metre, but a significant effect on syntax. &b1x; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3a.2;</mentioned> (for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.3a.2;</mentioned> and variants in all other manuscripts), 3a, involves the substitution of visually dissimilar synonyms. &b1x; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3b.4;</mentioned> (for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.3b.4;</mentioned> and variants in all other witnesses), 3b, is equally striking graphically, and has an effect on both metre and syntax. In these cases, the innovation is almost certainly to be ascribed to the same source as the more general innovation found in the &b1x; copy of the Old English &he; as a whole. As the following collation of a single page from &b1x; against &t1x; demonstrates, similar substitutions, inflectional differences, and additions and omissions of words are found throughout the &b1x; copy of the framing prose text (the following extracts have been transcribed from the facsimiles in this edition; punctuation as in &miller1890;.

	 <p rend="noindent">Further confirmation of this tendency comes from Grant&rsquo;s exhaustive survey of innovation in the &b1x; copy of Bede (&grant1989;). The addition of <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.2;</mentioned> to 1a of &ch;, for example, is paralleled by <quote id="CH7.QUOTE.0070">83</quote> examples in &b1x; of the addition of a <quote id="CH7.QUOTE.0080">noun or pronoun as the subject or object</quote> for verbs which appear without an explicit subject or object in &t1x; (331-2, 336-7).<note id="CH7.NOTE.250" n="24"><p>The figure <quote id="CH7.QUOTE.0090">83</quote> is given on 331.

In Grant&rsquo;s citations, &b1x; substitutes <mentioned lang="ANG">god</mentioned>(-) for &t1x; <mentioned lang="ANG">driht(e)n</mentioned>(-) five times, &b1x; <mentioned lang="ANG">driht(e)n</mentioned>(-) for &t1x; <mentioned lang="ANG">god</mentioned>- twice. &b1x; and &t1x; agree in <mentioned lang="ANG">god</mentioned>(-) twice for <mentioned lang="ANG">driht(e)n</mentioned>(-) in other manuscripts of the &historia;. See &grant1989;, 51-2.</p></note>  Variation in the choice of adjectives is also frequent (approximately 150 examples), although &ch; 3a is the only example Grant cites of a substitution involving <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3b.4;</mentioned> or <mentioned lang="ANG">gehwa</mentioned> (98-108). The substitution <mentioned lang="ANG">astealde</mentioned> for <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.4b.2;</mentioned> is but one example of hundreds of similar variants in the use of prefixes with nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs (84-9 [nouns]; 109-110 [adjectives]; 127 [adverbs]; and 197-218 [verbs]).<note id="CH7.NOTE.265" n="26"><p>Grant does not include the variant from &ch; in his list of variants in the use of prefixes.</p></note> The substitution of the relative pronoun for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.7a.1;</mentioned> in &ch;, 7a, is one of numerous examples of the (correct and incorrect) substitution or addition of the relative particle (131-132 and 143-4).</p>
	 <p id="CH7.640" n="7.62">As was the case with &b1x;, the unique variation in &tox; is probably best attributed to the context in which it is found: in this case as perhaps memorial error introduced when the text was first placed in the marginal context. Its two unique forms, <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfto.6b.2;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.6b.2;</mentioned>, 6b, and <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfto.4b.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.4b.1;</mentioned> (as in &t1x;, &nx; and the pre-correction &ox;) or <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.4b.1;</mentioned> (as in &b1x;, the corrected form of &ox;, and &cax;), 4b, involve the substitution of a synonym and approximate homograph and homophone respectively. The two forms it shares with &b1x;, the addition of <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.2;</mentioned> to 1a and the substitution <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfto.4b.2;</mentioned> for &t1x; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.4b.2;</mentioned>, 4b, involve changes that bring the text closer in line with the &ylda;&mdash;a motive which, as we shall see, may also influence the scribes of &b1x; and &ox; (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r570; and &ch7r580;). This in turn suggests that these particular variants may have arisen independently. While it is relatively certain that &tox; belongs to the recension&rsquo;s &t1x;-&b1x; tradition, its precise place in the stemma remains indeterminate:</p>

       <head id="CH7.2.5.3.HEAD">Editorial approach</head>
       <p id="CH7.650" n="7.63">The principal textual problem facing an editor of the &eorthan; of &ch; is that of the recension&rsquo;s significant textual variation. On the one hand, as argued above (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch5x170;-&ch5x330;), the &eorthanShortReference; text is probably, in its earliest witnesses at least, the most substantively conservative of all surviving versions of the poem. In particular, it shows no evidence of the influence of Bede&rsquo;s Latin &paraphrase; in 1a, 5b, or 9a in &t1x;, &cx;/&nx;, or (the precorrection form of) &ox;. On the other hand, the recension also shows by far the greatest amount of significant textual variation among its surviving witnesses. &b1x;, the most innovative witness in any recension of the poem, differs from its presumed ancestor &t1x; in seven significant readings. &cax;, the latest member of the &cx;/&nx;-&ox;-&cax; sub-recension, contains five significant readings that differ from the pre-correction text of &ox;, its immediate (or very close) ancestor.</p>
       <p id="CH7.660" n="7.64">This variation is all the more striking when it is compared to that found among the witnesses to the three other comparable recensions of &ch; (as argued above, &ch7rEordu;, the evidence suggests that all witnesses to the &eordu; are continental descendants of a single Insular witness). The seven surviving witnesses to the &ylda; show a total of four potentially significant textual variants, of which three are obvious errors preserved in fourteenth- and fifteenth- century manuscripts and the fourth a metrically inappropriate substitution of marginal sense in the hand of a demonstrably careless scribe. The two eighth-century witnesses to the &aelda; differ in two potentially significant forms: a dialectal and metrically transparent substitution of the synonyms and a probable scribal error. Even the relatively corrupt &eorthe; shows only two sets of significant variants among its three witnesses in the equivalent to 3b and 8b (see below, &ch7rEorthe;).</p>
       <p id="CH7.670" n="7.65">As important as the sheer amount of textual variation found among the witnesses to the &eorthan;, however, is its significance. Where, among the witnesses to the other recensions, sensible, metrical, and syntactically appropriate variation is the exception, among witnesses to the &eorthan;, such variation is the norm. Of the approximately eighteen substantive variants exhibited by the six surviving witnesses of the &eorthan;, only five involve clearly inappropriate forms: the four probably sixteenth-century errors in &cx;/&nx;, and the substitution <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfto.4b.1;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfeo.4b.1;</mentioned> in 4b of &tox;. While the remaining variants are not always aesthetically preferable to those found in the other recensions, they are on the whole reasonably sensible and syntactically and metrically appropriate&mdash;and certainly make much better sense than the omission of <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.8a.2;</mentioned> from 8b of &carmsx;, or the substitutions <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfm.6b.2;</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfw.4b.1;</mentioned> in &mx; 6b, and &wx; 4b, respectively.</p>
       <p id="CH7.680" n="7.66">A final important aspect of the variation exhibited by the witnesses to the &eorthan; of the &hymn; is its distribution. For the variants themselves are not found equally in all six manuscripts. While all witnesses except &t1x; introduce unique readings, none shows the same pattern of variation or introduces its variation for the same reasons. The five unique readings in &cx;/&nx; are all errors explainable by the misapprehension of individual letters and forms by the scribe of &cx; or its sixteenth-century transcriber. The four substantive differences between &tox; and &t1x; can be explained as a result of contamination by the &ylda; or scribal lapses. &cax;, as noted above, shows only one variant not found in the corrected text of &ox;, <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfca.3b.3;</mentioned> for <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3b.3;</mentioned> in 3b.</p>
       <p id="CH7.690" n="7.67">The two manuscripts responsible for the bulk of the variants exhibited by the witnesses to the &eorthanShortReference; text, &ox; and &b1x;, similarly, vary in different ways and for different reasons. Where &b1x; is the product of a highly innovative scribe who shows considerable freedom in copying both the &hymn; and the framing text of the prose Old English &he;, the scribe of &ox; is a relatively conservative copyist who introduces the majority of his innovations by correction (as &miller1890; notes, such corrections are found throughout the &ox; text of the Old English &historia; [xviii-xx]). Apart from the expected forms for the transcription errors, the uncorrected text of &ox; introduces only three forms not found in its earlier relative (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch7r480;). In its corrected state, &ox; <socalled>corrects</socalled> <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.9a.2;</mentioned> to <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.9a.2;</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned> to <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned> and adds another two potentially significant substantive variants: <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.1a.2;</mentioned>, 1a; and <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.4b.1;</mentioned> (corrected from <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.4b.1;</mentioned>, 4b). Since these sensible and syntactically and metrically appropriate variants are all made by correction and since all but one (<mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned>) are found in other recensions of the &hymn;, it seems likely that the &ox; scribe was either collating his already-copied text against a witness to the &ylda;,<note id="CH7.NOTE.270" n="27"><p>The &ox; scribe does not adopt any of the &ylda;&rsquo;s most innovative readings: <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.3b.4;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.7a.1;</mentioned>, and <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.8b.2;</mentioned> (see above, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch7r340;-&ch7r370;). This may indicate that a second, corrected copy of the &ylda; was in circulation, or it may be further evidence to suggest that the &ylda;&rsquo;s remarkable stability was the result of a deliberate scribal policy which the &ox; scribe, who was copying his text in a different context, felt free to ignore.</p></note> or knew a similar text by heart and corrected his exemplar to match the version with which he was more familiar (both possibilities are discussed briefly by &jabbour1968;, 197). That this second possibility may be the more likely is suggested by the fact that he neither adopts any of the &ylda;&rsquo;s nonsensical readings nor corrects <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned> to <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.3a.1;</mentioned> as in the &ylda; and all other versions of the poem: <mentioned rend="postcorrection" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0220" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0220">of men,</gloss> looks very much like what we might describe as a memorial conflation or misguided attempt at correction. It is, on the one hand, syntactically and semantically similar to the reading preserved in &cx;/&nx; <mentioned rend="postcorrection" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0230" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.3a.1;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0230">of hosts</gloss>: the fact that the final <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">a</seg> in the corrected &ox; form is written over what looks like an original <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">o</seg> may even suggest the scribe began to write <mentioned lang="ANG">weroda</mentioned> before changing his mind. On the other hand, however, <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned> is also graphically similar to <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH7.MENTIONED.0240" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.3a.1;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH7.MENTIONED.0240">work(s),</gloss> and fills an equivalent slot in the metrical line: where the &cx;/&nx; reading is Type D*2 or D*4, the &ox; text is Type D-2 or D-4 (as in all other recensions of the &hymn;). Recognising that the &cx;/&nx; form was incorrect, the scribe of &ox; appears to have corrected his original <mentioned rend="precorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfo.3a.1;</mentioned> by supplying a form which is semantically and grammatically similar to the form in &cx;/&nx;, but metrically equivalent to that in all other versions of the &hymn;.</p>
       <p id="CH7.700" n="7.68">In contrast to the relatively pedestrian &ox;, the &b1x; text is far more spontaneous and innovative. None of the seven differences it exhibits from the text of its closest surviving ancestor are by correction. On the one hand, of course, this may suggest simply that the variants have been inherited from an earlier copy. &b1x; was copied by two scribes and, in as much as Grant reports no real difference in the amount or type of innovation in each scribe&rsquo;s stint, it appears that the manuscript may owe much of its originality to some earlier exemplar. On the other hand, however, the variants themselves are also in most cases of a different type: where all but one of the five variants introduced by the corrections to &ox; are found in other versions of the &hymn;, four of the seven variants attested in &b1x; are unparalleled among the &hymn;&rsquo;s other witnesses, and, in one case, indeed, anywhere else in the poetic corpus.<note id="CH7.NOTE.280" n="28"><p><mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.3;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.1a.4;</mentioned>, 1a, is also found in &Seasons;, 39a; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3b.3;</mentioned> <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3b.4;</mentioned> appears four other times with <mentioned lang="ANG">wundra</mentioned> as a simplex (&Ex;, 10b; &OrW;, 7b; &Rid21;, 8b; &Rid84;, 10b) and another three with <mentioned lang="ANG">wundra</mentioned> as the second element of a compound; <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.3a.2;</mentioned> (indeed any compound of <mentioned lang="ANG">wuldor</mentioned> with <mentioned lang="ANG">god</mentioned>) is unparalleled in the poetic corpus (&healeyetal1994;); while the substitution <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfb1.7a.1;</mentioned> for <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.7a.1;</mentioned> is more difficult to check against the corpus, it seems to be syntactically permissible.</p></note></p>
       <p id="CH7.710" n="7.69">A critical text of the &eorthan; has then, ideally, two competing goals. On the one hand, the evidence of the surviving manuscripts suggests that, with the exception of &b1x; and, possibly, &ox;, most scribes attempted to reproduce their exemplars with a reasonable degree of accuracy. While the amount of innovation among witnesses to this recension is less than that found among witnesses to the &yldaShortReference; tradition, the variants introduced tend on the whole towards what looks very much like memorial contamination and trivialisation. On the other hand, the evidence of &ox; and &b1x; shows that not all scribes of this recension shared this desire for accuracy.</p>
       <p id="CH7.720" n="7.70">Taken together this evidence suggests both that it is possible to reconstruct a text closely resembling the original exemplar of the &eorthan;, and that the reproduction of this text was a primary goal of most of the recension&rsquo;s scribes. That this text resembled that of &t1x; in almost every respect is suggested by the distribution of variants among the surviving witnesses, and, in particular, by the relative lack of significant substantive textual variation between &t1x;, &cx; (as represented by &nx;), and the uncorrected &ox;.</p>
       <p id="CH7.730" n="7.71">The second goal for any new edition of the &eorthan; involves providing readers with a sense of the text&rsquo;s development. The changes introduced in &ox; and &b1x; represent very different types of scribal performances. Where the majority of innovations in &b1x; are found in no other copy of &ch;, four out of the five introduced in &ox; are found in other versions of the poem. Where the scribes responsible for the innovations in &b1x; appear to have worked relatively fluently, the scribe responsible for &ox; <socalled>performed</socalled> primarily by correction. In presenting the &b1x; and &ox; performances as editions&mdash;rather than simply part of the witness archive supporting all recensions of the &hymn;&mdash;&ech; draws readers&rsquo; attention to both the nature of the performances and their significance to the development of this recension: the &b1x; edition presents an editorially lineated version of the poem with an apparatus emphasising the significant differences this text shows to &t1x; and &tox; and members of the &cx;/&nx;-&ox;-&cax; sub-recension; the &ox; text focuses on the scribe&rsquo;s performance-as-process by recording the corrections, additions, and deletions in the editorial text. By comparing these various editorial texts with each other and the variants presented in the accompanying textual apparatus, readers can gain a sense of the decisions these redactors made in altering their original text.</p>

As the following diagram illustrates, the three witnesses can be broken into two main branches, with &ldx; and &hrx; in one, and &carmsx; in the other. This division is suggested by a series of mutually exclusive errors in the two branches: a scribe in the tradition represented by &carmsx; has had trouble with the insular forms of <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">g</seg>, <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">&wynn;</seg>, <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">f</seg>, and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">r</seg> (e.g. <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfar.2b.3;</mentioned>; <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfar.3a.1;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="diplomatic" lang="ANG">&copyOfar.9a.1;</mentioned>); &ldx; and &hrx;, on the other hand, both show a confusion of <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">n</seg> and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">o</seg>, not found in &carmsx;, in <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfhr.9.2;</mentioned>:</p>

       <p id="CH7.780" n="7.76">The &eorthe; poses two main problems for the editor. The first involves determining the recension&rsquo;s relationship to other versions of the poem; the second finding an appropriate medium for the presentation of the poem&rsquo;s corrupt text.</p>

	<head id="CH7.2.6.3.1.HEAD">Relationship of the &eorthe; to other versions of the &hymn;.</head>  
	<p id="CH7.790" n="7.77">Until recently, the &eortheShortReference; text was assumed to be a corruption of the &eorthan; (e.g. &dobbie1937;, 43; &odonnell1996b;, Appendix). This assumption, which appears to have been questioned first by Schwab (&schwab1972a;, 15-17), was based primarily on the similarities of dialect between the &eortheShortReference; and &eorthanShortReference; texts and the fact that both versions contained an inflected form of <mentioned lang="ANG">eor&eth;e</mentioned>, 5b. The assumption ignores, however, a number of other features that would seem to ally the &eorthe; more closely with the &wsylda; or &neordu; texts: like the &eorduShortReference; and &yldaShortReference; recensions, the &eortheShortReference; version is found exclusively in copies of the Latin &he;; like &eorduShortReference; and &yldaShortReference;, it has an explicit pronominal subject in 1a and adds <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.8a.2;</mentioned> to 9a; the recension&rsquo;s eponymous reading in 5b, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.4b.1;</mentioned> can perhaps be more easily explained as a corruption of an original <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfeo.5b.1;</mentioned> showing Northumbrian loss of inflectional <seg type="linguistic" subtype="phonemic">n</seg> than as a late weakening of West-Saxon weak endings, especially since the surviving witnesses agree for the most part in preserving the full form of similar endings throughout the rest of the poem (e.g. <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.1b.1;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.5a.1;</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.6a.2;</mentioned>; cf. &cavill2000;, 506 and 510). The only problem with this assumed derivation from the &eordu;, indeed, lies in the textual history of the Latin &he;: &hrx;, like &ldx;, &carmsx;, and all other surviving witnesses to Bede&rsquo;s Latin &historia; except for &mx; and &lx;, belongs to the <socalled>English</socalled> or <label rend="oblique">c</label>-text of the &he;; witnesses to the &eordu; all appear to belong to the <socalled>German</socalled> or <label rend="oblique">m</label>-text version. If the &eorthe; has indeed been translated from the &eordu;, the scribe responsible for the initial copy of this version would presumably also have had to have access to a <socalled>German</socalled> text of the &he;.</p>

	<head id="CH7.2.6.3.2.HEAD">Textual corruptions</head>
	<p id="CH7.800" n="7.78">The second major problem facing editors of the &eorthe; involves its many obvious corruptions. On the one hand, the three surviving witnesses clearly are descended from an extremely corrupt original. While they show some minor differences and one major variant (discussed below), all three manuscripts agree in omitting all or some of 3b-4a, dropping all of 4b, and moving the equivalent of 6b to the end of the poem. On the other hand, however, this corrupt text appears to have undergone some development itself. In &ldx; and &carmsx;, 3b and 4a show signs of what may be an attempt to repair the damage caused by the omission of 4b: by adding <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfex.7a.1;</mentioned> (an adverb found at this point of the poem in no other recension) to the end of 4a, the two manuscripts make what could be understood as an unsuccessful attempt at linking the poem&rsquo;s first and second halves. In &hrx;, this editorial intervention may have been carried further: by dropping 4a, and most of 3b as well as 4b, &hrx; turns the equivalent of 3a-6a into a single clause&mdash;making, with the exception of <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.4b.1;</mentioned>, marginally acceptable sense if usual metre:</p>

	<quote corresp="CH7.QUOTE.0110">
	 <p>As he first made heaven as a roof for men &dagger;earth&dagger;.</p>
	</quote>
	<p id="CH7.810" n="7.79">The problem with this variation, however, is that it may or may not be deliberate. While the change makes some (albeit still problematic) sense out of a passage that is irredeemably garbled in &ldx; and &carmsx;, the <socalled>correction</socalled> itself looks suspiciously like a scribal error: the omitted text from &ldx; begins and ends with the pronoun <mentioned lang="ANG">he</mentioned>&mdash;suggesting eyeskip might have played as important a role as a desire to fix the manuscript&rsquo;s nonsensical original. In addition, the &hrx; text shows no signs of having attempted repairs to other corrupt sections of the text (including, indeed, the problematic ending on <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.4b.1;</mentioned>).</p>
	<p id="CH7.820" n="7.80">Despite these doubts about the intentions of the &hrx; <socalled>editor,</socalled> &ech; bases its critical text of the recension on this late version of the poem. In doing so, it departs from its practice in editing the &wsylda;, &neordu;, and &wseorthan; recensions. In these editions, the editorial goal has been the reconstruction of either an idealised, pre-corruption form of the text represented by the surviving witnesses, or in the case of the <socalled>uncorrected</socalled> text of the &ylda;, the recension&rsquo;s earliest form, corruptions and all.</p>
	<p id="CH7.830" n="7.81">The critical text of the &eorthe; is different, however, in that its primary interest lies in the text&rsquo;s transmission history. A critical reconstruction of the recension&rsquo;s ideal (i.e. non-corrupt) original would produce something that differed in no substantive way from a West-Saxon translation of the reconstructed &eordu;. The original, corrupt, exemplar of the recensions would presumably look much like &ldx;. By selecting the latest manuscript of this recension for its critical text, this edition shows what happened to a recension as it was transmitted by scribes who were neither as careful as the &yldaShortReference; scribes, nor as interested in preserving sense and metre as those responsible for &b1x; and &ox;. The changes introduced in the version represented by &hrx; improve the sense of the poem without bringing it any closer to its original state. To the extent this is deliberate, it represents a style of transmission seen nowhere else in the Old English poetic corpus (&odonnell1996a;). To the extent these changes are the result of a scribal error, they demonstrate the way in which scribal mistakes can compound to change a text&rsquo;s form and meaning irreparably (see &moffat1992;). Either way, they are evidence of the fate of texts in a late scribal tradition.</p>
