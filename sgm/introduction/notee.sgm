      <p id="NOTEE.470" n="E.1">The following contains a list of all published proposed <socalled>analogues</socalled> to the C&aelig;dmon story used in the preparation of &ch2x; (see &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch2x300;-&ch2x450; for a detailed discussion of analogues to the &hymn; itself). The list contains supposed narrative analogues only. Anthropological and sociological parallels to the C&aelig;dmon story have been excluded.<note id="NOTEE.NOTE.170" n="1"><p>Examples of such parallels include &fritz1969;, &fritz1974;, and &irvine1991; (in which C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training and career is compared to that of novice monks, exegetes, or religious poets); and &kleiner1988; and certain aspects of &magoun1955; and &orton1983; (in which C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training is compared to that of historical oral poets). I have also excluded a number of interesting but unpublished accounts of parallels suggested to me informally by colleagues, friends, and students. Examples include the Pentecost (suggested by Virgil Grandfield), Joseph Smith (Karen Hann), and William McGonagall, Poet and Tragedian (Philip Rusche).</p></note> Each entry contains a brief summary of the relevant details, in most cases quoted directly from the scholar responsible for proposing the analogue, and selected references to significant discussions in the secondary literature.<note id="NOTEE.NOTE.180" n="2"><p><socalled>Significant</socalled> in this context means work that adds new information to our knowledge of the analogue in question or its relationship to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story or &hymn;. With the exception of the important review articles, &pound1929; and &lester1974;, I have not recorded bibliographic information on articles that simply summarise previous studies.</p></note> With a few exceptions (particularly, but not exclusively, the stories of Mohammed, Ntsikana, and Aldhelm discussed in &ch2x;), no attempt has been made to trace analogues back to their original sources. Readers interested in further details of these stories are encouraged to begin their research with the sources cited.</p>

       <head id="ABID">Ab&imacr;d ben al-Abras (&lester1974;; &khafaji1972;)</head>
       
       <p>&ldquo;Ab&imacr;d ben al-Abras was a poor man with no possessions. One day he came with a small flock of sheep towards water. With him was his sister, Mawiyya. A man from the tribe of Malek ben Tha&rsquo;alaba confronted him and prevented him from leading his sheep to the water. Ab&imacr;d went away saddened by this challenge. He came to a small bush under the shade of which he slept. His sister also slept under those trees. It is said that the man from Malek, who had confronted him, came upon them and accused Ab&imacr;d of incest and expressed this accusation in three lines of poetry....</p>
       <p>&ldquo;Ab&imacr;d, hearing this, raised his hands to heaven in supplication saying: &lsquo;O God, this man has done me a terrible wrong with his false accusation. Avenge me, and help me overcome him.&rsquo;.... Ab&imacr;d then went back to sleep. It is said that an apparition came to him in his sleep, with a big bundle of poems, which the apparition threw into Ab&imacr;d&rsquo;s mouth saying, &lsquo;Recite this, for you shall be the most eleoquent [&sic;] poet in Arabia, the most glorious among the Arabs. Your poverty is the result of your generosity and kindness to your kith and kin.&rsquo;  So Ab&imacr;d woke up, extemporaneously reciting poetry against the tribe of Malek. His fame as a great poet continued to glow [&sic;] among his people from that time, recognized by everybody until he was killed&rdquo; (translation by Mohammed T. Bujairami, quoted in &lester1974;, 227, n. 16).</p>

       <p>In Pausanias&rsquo; <title level="m">Description of Greece</title> I. 21: &ldquo;&AElig;schylus recounts that Dionysus appeared to him in his sleep, when he was a stripling, and bade him write tragedy, and later, on awakening, he found that he could do so&rdquo; (&pound1929;, 234).</p>

       <head id="ANNUNCIATION">Annunciation and birth of Christ (&orton1983;)</head>
       
       <p>&ldquo;The most obvious parallel [to the biblical story of the annunciation and birth of Christ in the C&aelig;dmon story] is in the setting: C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vision and Christ&rsquo;s birth both take place in a stable. Both Mary and C&aelig;dmon are visited, Mary by an angel, C&aelig;dmon by an unnamed &lsquo;somebody&rsquo; (&lsquo;quidam&rsquo;). Mary, a virgin, is puzzled by the news that she will bear a child; C&aelig;dmon seems perplexed that he should be asked to sing after leaving the feast precisely because he is unable to do so. In Mary&rsquo;s case, pregnancy follows a natural course, whereas in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s, conception and delivery are, so to speak, one. To Mary&rsquo;s virginity corresponds C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inexperience in composing and learning poems. Just as the gospel, in Matthew, states that sexual relations between Joseph and Mary were delayed (to say the least) until after Christ&rsquo;s birth, so C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story stresses that his <title level="m">Hymn</title> and all subsequent works came into being through divine grace alone; that C&aelig;dmon had learnt nothing from the recitations of his fellows, despite his exposure to them. He was thus as pure in his way as Mary was in hers, and no more open to the charge of having rooted Christian English poetry in pagan soil than Mary is of having borne Joseph&rsquo;s son&rdquo; (&orton1983;, 165-166).</p>

       <head id="BEOWULF">Feast scenes in &Beo; (&osborn1989;)</head>
       
	<p>&ldquo;At a formal ceremonial occasion like the banquet scenes in lines 612-64 and 1228-31 of &Beo;, a splendid cup might be passed around, with each person who receives it expected to make some sort of formal declaration, perhaps either praise for a king or hero or a heroic oath.... Despite the lack of evidence in Bede&rsquo;s sober text, I think that elderly Caedmon might have found himself at such a party, and foreseen the jovial group turning to look at him, when he knew himself incapable of taking his turn as the situation demanded&rdquo; (&osborn1989;, 16).</p>

When he awoke, he conversed in the Bulgarian and the Greek idioms with which he was previously unfamiliar&rdquo; (&loomis1946;, 410).</p>

       <head id="CENNFAELED">Cennfaeled mac Ailella (&ireland1986;; &dumville1981;)</head>
       <p>Cennfaeled mac Ailella was a mid seventh-century ecclesiastic of aristocratic origin who was wounded at the battle of Magh Rath (c. 637) and removed to Tuaim Drecain to be healed. In the course of his treatment, Cennfaeled had his <foreign lang="SGA">ichinn dermait,</foreign> &ldquo;brain of forgetting,&rdquo; removed, leaving him with a prodigious memory (&ireland1986;, 113). He then began a course of study in which he was taught &ldquo;lore of <foreign id="NOTEE.FOREIGN.0030" lang="SGA">l&eacute;gend</foreign> (ecclesiastical learning), <foreign id="NOTEE.FOREIGN.0040" lang="SGA">f&eacute;nechas</foreign> (native law), and <foreign id="NOTEE.FOREIGN.0050" lang="SGA">filidecht</foreign> (native poetics and general literary, pseudo-historical, and topographical tradition)&rdquo; (&dumville1981;, 147). Because of his excellent memory, Cennfaeled was able to learn each day&rsquo;s lesson by heart and &ldquo;put a &lsquo;fine thread of poetry&rsquo;&rdquo; around it before writing it out on tablets and subsequently transcribing it into codices; he is said to have left &ldquo;a &lsquo;large number of well composed books&rsquo; after him&rdquo; (&dumville1981;, 147).</p>

       <head id="DREAMSONGS">Chippewa dream songs (&pound1929;)</head>
       <p>Chippewa dream songs are composed &ldquo;during a dream or on waking from a dream&rdquo; (Frances Densmore, quoted in &pound1929;, 237):</p>
       
	<p>&ldquo;The story of one song... is that when the composer was a boy he had a dream, and in his dream he heard the trees singing as though they were alive. When he awoke he made up the song, in which he repeats what he heard the trees say. Another youth heard the crows in the trees and imagined he learned his song from them. The song was first a dream song and then a war-dance song&rdquo; (&pound1929;, 237).</p>

       <p>Colm&aacute;n mac L&eacute;n&eacute;ni (&ob; &circa; 600) was a professional poet before he became a monk. He composed his poetry, including a surviving four line fragment in which he refers to his composition process, in an &ldquo;inspired sleep&rdquo; (&ireland1997;, 2-3).</p>

	<p>&ldquo;A[n]... oblique reference in Old English verse to the... theme of pious poetic inspiration, and to circumstances similar to those in which C&aelig;dmon found himself, appears in the course of the lengthy (and Latinate) rhyming passage which occurs towards the end of <title level="m">Elene</title> (lines 1236-51), where an aged man (in this case Cynewulf) claims to have been inspired to song, after a long period of night-time contemplation, by God, who has &lsquo;unlocked&rsquo; his song-craft&rdquo; (&orchard1996;, 410-411).</p>

	<p>&ldquo;After compline and pious devotion one night, Dunstan in sleep was rapt to heaven. There he saw his own mother joined in marriage to a mighty king amid great rejoicing. From all sides rose hymns and music. While Dunstan listened in delight and attended with all his heart to what was going on, a young man clad in white brilliance came up to him and said: &lsquo;When you see and hear these choirs in jubilation, why do you not join it?&rsquo; Dunstan replied that he did not know what to sing in honour of so great a king. So the young man taught him the antiphon, <title level="m">O rex gentium</title>. In his vision Dunstan repeated the antiphon many times and in the morning, when he had risen from sleep, had it copied down lest it pass out of memory&rdquo; (&shepherd1954;, 114).</p>

       <p>Egil is already an accomplished poet. Trapped in York and threatened with death by Erik Bloodaxe, Egil is persuaded by his friend Arijbj&ocedil;rn to compose a poem in Erik&rsquo;s honour, in the hope that this will convince him to spare his life. Egil&rsquo;s attempts are frustrated, however, by a magical swallow that prevents him from composing by singing at his window. When Arijbj&ocedil;rn investigates, the bird flies away, allowing Egil to compose his song.</p>

       <head id="EQUITIUS">Equitius (&loomis1946;)</head>
       
	<p>Gregory recounts the following story in his <title level="m">Dialogues</title> (I. 4): &ldquo;A certain Equitius, although not in holy orders, nevertheless preached to many at various places. When he was questioned, he gave the explanation that a young man had appeared to him in a dream and touched his tongue with a lancet used for letting blood, saying, &lsquo;Behold, I have put my word into your mouth! Go forth to your preaching.&rsquo;  From that day, even though he wished, he could not keep silent concerning God&rdquo; (&loomis1946;, 410).</p>

       <head id="FINN">Finn MacCoul (&lerer1991;)</head>
       
	<p>&ldquo;Like many traditional accounts, Caedmon&rsquo;s naming represents the sanctioning of the poet or poetic figure by specially empowered authorities. In the story of Finn MacCoul, for example, the young hero is transformed into a poet through the eating of the cooked salmon and the sucking of his burned thumb. Allusively combining references to sacred food and spittle, this moment in the &lsquo;Boyhood Exploits of Finn&rsquo; announces that &lsquo;whenever he put his thumb into his mouth, and sang through <foreign id="NOTEE.FOREIGN.0060" lang="SGA">teinn laida</foreign> [illumination of song?], then whatever he had been ignorant of would be revealed to him....&rsquo; The new poet is then renamed: &lsquo;Finn is thy name, my lad&rsquo;. The narrator continues, &lsquo;It is then Finn made this lay to prove his poetry....&rsquo; Much like the Irish poet&rsquo;s performance of his lay&mdash;a pastoral of Creation&mdash;C&aelig;dmon, newly named, sings his own hymn of Creation to &lsquo;prove his poetry&rsquo; to himself and his angel&rdquo; (&lerer1991;, 43-44).</p>

       <head id="FOOL">Fool of Dunmore (&vincent1946;)</head>
       
	<p>&ldquo;In the old times, there was a half-fool living in Dunmore, in the county of Galway, and although he was excessively fond of music, he was unable to learn more than one tune, and that was the &lsquo;Black Rogue&rsquo;. ...One night the piper was coming home from a house where there had been a dance, and he was half drunk. When he came to a little bridge that was up by his mother&rsquo;s house, he squeezed the pipes on, and began playing the &lsquo;Black Rogue&rsquo;.... The P&uacute;ca came behind him, and flung him up on his own back. There were long horns on the P&uacute;ca, and the piper got a good grip of them...</p>
	<p>&ldquo;Then the P&uacute;ca said to him, &lsquo;Play up for me the &ldquo;Shan Van Vocht&rdquo;...&rsquo;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;, said the piper.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind whether you do or you don&rsquo;t&rsquo;, said the P&uacute;ca. &lsquo;Play up, and I&rsquo;ll make you know&rsquo;.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;The piper put wind in his bag, and he played such music as made himself wonder... and from that day till the day of his death, there was never a piper in the county Galway was as good as he was&rdquo; (Douglas Hyde, cited in &vincent1946;, 61).</p>

	<p>&ldquo;[T]he abbot Fursey, a holy man from Ireland, had been found worthy to see heavenly visions. In his infirmity, one day towards evening, while he was occupied in psalmody and prayer, suddenly he fell into a trance and was carried home as one dead. In his trance his soul was borne aloft by angels singing the half-verse, <mentioned lang="LAT">Ibunt sancti de virtute in virtutem</mentioned> (Ps. lxxxiv. 7).

All the people from the time of Adam to the present day had assembled. In the background there were shades twelve stories tall.

To the left side of the scales there stood a short man with a pock-marked face and a yellow complexion. In his hand he held a yellow book. The one with the yellow book in his hand would say a word about each of the people coming to the scale and the other, the impressive one, would say a verse about them.... The big one said to me, &lsquo;Have you learned it, my son?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, I answered, &lsquo;I have learned it&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Read it out and let me see&rsquo;.  And I recited it. He touched me on the shoulder with his left hand. &lsquo;Now you stand over there, my child. Let someone else approach&rsquo;.  Just then a short, old minstrel, some seventy to seventy-five years of age with a conical hat on his head, appeared. This minstrel had a <foreign lang="FAS">saz</foreign> in his hands....</p>
	 <p>&ldquo;They showed me a yellow book, saying, &lsquo;Read the writing on this book, my child&rsquo;.  &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to read&rsquo;, I said.... &lsquo;Look at it, my child&rsquo;, he said. It was writing in an old script, about two fingers high. What was written on the book was: H&acirc;z&acirc; Divan&icirc; A&scedil;ik M&uuml;dam&icirc;.
