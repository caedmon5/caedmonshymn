     <head id="CH3.1.HEAD">Introduction</head>
     <p id="CH3.005" n="3.1">The preceding chapters suggest that Bede was impressed by C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s skill as a poet and interested in demonstrating how unusual he was as a composer and performer. Although few modern scholars have shared Bede&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the intrinsic aesthetic quality of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s work, more have shown an interest in the question of his distinctiveness, arguing either that his poetry developed primarily out of (non-native) Christian traditions, or, more commonly, that his <socalled>bold adaptation</socalled> of pagan Germanic conventions to Christian ends marks the beginning of a new vernacular tradition in Old English and the other Germanic languages.<note id="CH3.NOTE.005" n="1"><p>C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s significance to the development of (Christian) Old English vernacular poetry is a critical commonplace; the wider importance of his <socalled>school</socalled> among the Germanic speaking peoples is discussed in &green1965;, 286-300. For the suggestion that the poet&rsquo;s primary debt is to non-Germanic poetic or compositional traditions see, among others, &blakenf1962;, esp. 245; &howlett1974;, 10.</p></note></p>
     <p id="CH3.008" n="3.2">As we shall see there is little evidence to support either claim. Structurally speaking, &ch; is a very Germanic poem. It shows a deep debt to the same major metrical, stylistic, and formulaic conventions found in other, mostly later, verse texts in Old English and other Germanic languages. Stylistically, there is little evidence to suggest that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse played the innovative role commonly assigned to it in modern literary histories. Bede nowhere suggests that C&aelig;dmon was known for his formulaic innovation, and C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s use of traditional Germanic epithets to describe the Christian God betrays no self-consciousness about his own supposedly seminal role in the development of native Christian poetry. In fact, the surviving contemporary evidence suggests that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse was valued primarily for the prosodic and formulaic skill with which it was composed. While Bede&rsquo;s account does suggest that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training and methods of composition and performance were unusual, there is nothing in the &he; or the &hymn; itself to suggest that the poet&rsquo;s actual verse was strikingly innovative.</p>

     <head id="CH3.2.HEAD">Metre</head>
     <p id="CH3.030" n="3.3">Metrically, &ch; is an accomplished but very conservative poem. Its eighteen half-lines show four of the five major stress-patterns identified by Sievers and traditionally used to describe the most conservative Old English verse. Only Type C verses (i.e. verses showing the stress pattern <term type="stresspattern">&nostress;&stress;&stress;&nostress;</term>) are not found in the poem (in the following scansion, <term type="stresspattern">&stress;</term> indicates a <socalled>heavy</socalled> metrical lift, <term type="stresspattern">&resolution;</term> a <socalled>resolved</socalled> lift, <term type="stresspattern">&halfstress;</term> a half-lift, <term type="stresspattern">&nostress;</term> a metrical drop, and <term type="stresspattern">(&nostress;)</term> a syllable to be ignored in scansion):</p>

     <p id="CH3.040" n="3.4">Isaac and Creed have suggested on different grounds that the &hymn; shows an unusually high frequency and anomalous distribution of Sievers Type A lines (&creed1992;; &isaac1997;, 223-225).<note id="CH3.NOTE.040" n="2"><p>&isaac1997;, 224, incorrectly scans 9b as Type A-1 (<term type="stresspattern">Sx/Sx</term> in the notation of &russom1987;). Since <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0040"><mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0010" lang="ANG">eall</mentioned>- is stressed</quote> in compounds (&campbell1991;, &sect;&nbsp;86), the line is Type D-1 (in Pope&rsquo;s restatement of Sievers&rsquo;s notation), or <term type="stresspattern">S/Ssx</term> (in Russom&rsquo;s notation). See the scansion in &fulkandpope2001;, 141; also &creed1992;, 37.</p></note> Both claims are true in absolute terms: the &hymn; does show an unusually high number of Type A lines in both the on- and off-verse when compared to the corpus as a whole or to large poems such as &Beo;; it also shows an unusually high number of long lines with Type A verses on both sides of the caesura (comparison statistics can be found in &hutcheson1995;, Appendix D).<note id="CH3.NOTE.050" n="3"><p>Hutcheson&rsquo;s statistics are not precisely comparable, since his tables admit a sixth verse type (<socalled>Type 3</socalled>). The small number of <socalled>Type 3</socalled> verses and the large statistical uncertainty attached to &ch;, however, ensure that this anomaly does not invalidate the comparison. I am grateful to Dr. Jonathan Seldin of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Lethbridge for his help in interpreting the statistical significance of verse distribution and combinations in the &hymn;.</p></note> The small size of the sample in question, however, ensures that neither difference is statistically significant: the &hymn; shows anomalies for all verse combinations and types (except Sievers Type D in the on-verse) and can be paralleled easily by similarly anomalous distributions of verse types in other samples of similar length from the corpus (examples include the &LRid; and the first nine lines of the West-Saxon &Sea; poem).</p>
     <p id="CH3.050" n="3.5">&ch; agrees well with one particular aspect of the distribution of verse types in the Anglo-Saxon poetic corpus: the use of a light Type A-3 verse for the poem&rsquo;s initial half-line. As Stanley notes, such light lines are a characteristic choice for the opening of Old English poems, particularly biblical paraphrases, prayers, and translations (&stanley1987a;, 128-129). Parallels include &Dan;, &Sat;, &And;, &Sea;, &Fort;, &Hell;, &Alms;, &Pha;, &Aldhelm;, all of Cynewulf&rsquo;s poems, and a large number of Riddles and Boethian Metres.</p>
     <p id="CH3.060" n="3.6">In a brief article, Robinson challenges this view, suggesting instead that the &hymn;&rsquo;s first word, the adverb <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1a.1;</mentioned>, might have received contrastive stress for rhetorical purposes (&robinsonfc1993b;, 118-119)<note id="CH3.NOTE.060" n="4"><p>A similar suggestion is implicit in the discussion of <socalled>archetypal verses</socalled> in &creed1992; (see particularly the scansion of 1a on 41, fig. 1).</p></note>:</p>
     
      <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0050">
       <p><mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0020" lang="ANG">N&umacr;</mentioned> [in &ch;] means <q>in this new Christian age.</q> The familiar framework of the formulas of praise refers to the old heroic age that minted them; their Christian reshapings refer to the new age of Christianity. The introductory <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0030" lang="ANG">N&umacr;</mentioned> establishes the relationship between the two: <q>In the past we used these terms to praise men or pagan deities; <emph>now</emph> we must praise God with them.</q> The freight of meaning borne by the adverb <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0040" lang="ANG">n&umacr;</mentioned> being so heavy, I cannot think that it was submerged phonically in the murmur of a metrical dip. If any word in the poem must have logical and metrical emphasis, it would seem, it is this one.</p>
      </quote>
     <p id="CH3.070" n="3.7">While this reading is attractive, it is probably beyond demonstration. In the first place, as Robinson notes, it depends on the assumption that &ch; represents a bold Christianisation of traditional Germanic encomic poetry, <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0060">a poetic form that seems to have been primal in many heroic cultures and that must have been one of the commonest forms practised by Anglo-Saxon <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0050" lang="ANG">scopas</mentioned> during their pre-Christian period</quote> (&robinsonfc1993b;, 117). Although an eulogistic tradition of some type does appear to be implied by classical accounts of continental Germanic customs, the genre itself, as Opland, Bessinger and others have noted, is not actually attested in Old English or other early cognate literatures, leaving us no body of contemporary material against which to compare C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem (&opland1980;, 98; &bessinger1974;, 92; &lehmann1971;, 24-29).</p>
     <p id="CH3.075" n="3.8">In the second place, the adverb &nu; does not participate in the line&rsquo;s alliteration. As the alliteration of various forms of the demonstrative pronoun in &Beo; in 197, 790, 806, and 1797 demonstrates, Anglo-Saxon poets could indicate rhetorical emphasis by allowing elements that are normally without metrical stress to participate in alliteration, either as part of the main alliteration, or, as frequently occurs with &nu; elsewhere in the corpus, as part of a <socalled>transverse</socalled> or <socalled>crossed</socalled> pattern in which each stress in the on-verse alliterates on a different sound in the off-verse, e.g. &Beo; 2053, <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0060" lang="ANG">Nu her &thorn;ara banena<caesura>byre nathwylces</mentioned> (&stanley1974;, 142).<note id="CH3.NOTE.070" n="5"><p>Robinson notes Stanley&rsquo;s qualification, but argues that the participation of &nu; in transverse alliteration in Type A-3 lines in fact indicates that <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0090">this is... one of those areas of Old English prosody where stress can fall where it ordinarily would not fall when there is a special, contextual reason for stress</quote> (116). See &momma1997;, esp. 142, for a discussion of the placement of unstressed &nu; in Old English poetry.</p></note></p>
       <p id="CH3.078" n="3.9">Finally, as we shall see below (&sect;&nbsp;&ch3.30;), the interpretation is not supported by Bede&rsquo;s discussion of the poem&rsquo;s initial performance and reception, which includes little to suggest that C&aelig;dmon was either the first Anglo-Saxon poet to compose Christian Old English verse, or that others found his poetry to be noteworthy for anything other than its exceptional quality, effectiveness, and, to a lesser extent, unusual method of inspiration.</p>
     <p id="CH3.080" n="3.10">On the other hand, Robinson&rsquo;s suggestion may receive some support from Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase;, which, as we shall see, ignores or provides unusual translations for several key terms in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem and may indicate that Bede found C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s terminology so innovative as to warrant suppression in much the same way Green has argued Wulfila suppressed similar vocabulary in his Gothic translation of the Bible (see &green1965;, 278-279). Bede&rsquo;s <socalled>suppression</socalled> of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s epithets is itself quite uneven, however, and, as we shall see, can be explained perhaps better by reference to his desire to eliminate all syntactic apposition from his translation (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch3r250;-&ch3r280;, below).</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 id="CH3.3">
     <head id="CH3.3.HEAD">Alliteration and rhyme</head>
     <p id="CH3.090" n="3.11">Alliteration or initial rhyme is the most certain aspect of Old English poetic style (&hoover1985b;, 75, and the statistics in n. 1). The &hymn; agrees absolutely with standard expectations for the distribution and phonological characteristics of alliterative syllables in conservative Old English poetry. Consonantal alliteration in the poem always involves like consonants; vocalic <socalled>alliteration</socalled> pairs unlike vowels in every instance except 5 of the &aelda;. No line in the poem alliterates on palatal or velar <seg type="linguistic" subtype="phonemic">g</seg> or any of the <seg type="linguistic" subtype="phonemic">h</seg> or <seg type="linguistic" subtype="phonemic">s</seg> clusters, two tests often used for dating Old English verse (see &amos1980;, 93-96).</p>
     <p id="CH3.100" n="3.12">The distribution of alliterating sounds in the &hymn; also corresponds to standard Old English poetic practice. In the off-verse, alliteration is always found on the first stressed syllable and never on the second. In the on-verse alliteration falls on the first stressed syllable only or both the first and the second. There are no examples of crossed alliteration and relatively few lines showing double alliteration (in which both stresses in the on-verse alliterate with the first stress of the off-verse): in five lines, alliteration in the on-verse involves the first metrical stress only; in only four does it involve both. As Amos notes, this relatively low percentage of lines showing double alliteration is characteristic of all three externally datable Northumbrian poems, &ch;, &BDS;, and the &LRid;. It probably represents a regional stylistic feature (&amos1980;, 95-96).</p>
     <p id="CH3.110" n="3.13">One verse-pair in the poem is tied together by rhyme as well as alliteration: <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfl.7a.1; &copyOfl.7a.2;, &copyOfl.7b.1; &copyOfl.7b.2;</mentioned>, 7 (text: &lx;). That the device plays no structural importance in the poem (or line), however, is suggested by the Moore scribe&rsquo;s spelling of the same set of verses, in which the rhyme is partially obscured: <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfm.7a.1; &copyOfm.7a.2;, &copyOfm.7b.1; &copyOfm.7b.2;</mentioned> (see &stanley1988;, 23, and n. 10). The rhyme (or its West-Saxon equivalent, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfex.7a.2;</mentioned>... <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfex.7b.2;</mentioned>) is preserved in all other copies of all other recensions of the poem except &ylda;, where it is obscured by the use of an inflected form, <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.7a.1;</mentioned>, in the on-verse.</p>
     <p id="CH3.120" n="3.14">Howlett proposes an additional and complex series of rhymes linking various sections of the poem together (text adapted from &howlett1997;, 268-269; rhymes indicated by italic type<note id="CH3.NOTE.080" n="6"><p>Howlett&rsquo;s citation also uses underlining to indicate alliterative syllables (not reproduced here).</p></note>):</p>

     <p id="CH3.130" n="3.15">The very complexity of this system argues against its deliberateness. The rhymes indicated by Howlett&rsquo;s typography seem to involve a series of almost random correspondences. Howlett marks no rhymes in 1a, 2b, 3a-b, 5a-b, or 9a; the rhymes he does record vary greatly in significance and proximity (all spellings from Howlett&rsquo;s text): <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0090" lang="ANG">Uard</mentioned>, 1b and 7b, rhymes with <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0100" lang="ANG">middingard</mentioned>, 7a; <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0110" lang="ANG">Mehti</mentioned>, 2a, rhymes with <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0120" lang="ANG">Allmehtig</mentioned>, 9b; <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0130" lang="ANG">Eci Dryctin</mentioned> shows an identical rhyme in 4a and 8a; <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0140" lang="ANG">hefen</mentioned> and <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0150" lang="ANG">Sceppend</mentioned> show double rhyme in 6a and 6b; and the inflectional ending in <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0160" lang="ANG">astelid&aelig;</mentioned>, 4b, rhymes with that of <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0170" lang="ANG">tiad&aelig;</mentioned>, 8b (in light of the feminine rhyme in this last example, it is not clear why Howlett does not include two more examples: <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0180" lang="ANG">herga</mentioned> and <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0190" lang="ANG">Tha</mentioned>, 1a and 7a, and <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0200" lang="ANG">barnum</mentioned> and <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0210" lang="ANG">firum</mentioned>, 5b and 9a). While such correspondences may help give the text as a whole a sense of coherence (cf. the discussion of sound patterning in <title level="m">Kubla Khan</title> in &crystal1987;, 74), so few of the rhymes appear at regular intervals or involve necessarily connected ideas that it is difficult to see how an Anglo-Saxon auditor would be able to perceive them as being of structural importance.</p>

     <p id="CH3.140" n="3.16">Stylistically, &ch; is probably most remarkable for its heavy use of ornamental poetic variation, particularly in the poem&rsquo;s last five lines. The device has been formally defined in &robinsonfc1993a; (73) as consisting of</p>
     
      <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0100">
       <p>syntactically parallel words or word-groups which share a common referent and which occur within a single clause (or, in the instance of sentence-variation, within contiguous clauses).</p>
      </quote>
     <p rend="noindent">Informally, the term <socalled>variation</socalled> is often extended to cover the repetition of similar words or the restatement of similar ideas or concepts, regardless of whether or not they stand in strict syntactic apposition (see &robinsonfc1993a;, 71-73). As Robinson notes, this stylistic feature is so prominent in Old English verse that it attracts <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0110">the attention of even the most casual observer</quote>.</p>
     <p id="CH3.150" n="3.17">Regardless of the precise definition used, &ch; shows a great amount of poetic variation. Rhetorically, as Schwab has noted, epithets for God occur in the &hymn; at what approaches the maximum possible frequency: a noun, adjective, or pronoun referring to God the Father is found in every single line of the poem (&schwab1983b;, 23). Structurally, the poem can be divided into two major sections, each containing two clauses, of which the second can be read largely as an expansion of material in the first.<note id="CH3.NOTE.090" n="7"><p>This reading assumes <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3b.1;</mentioned> in 3b is a conjunction; for an alternative, asymmetrical, reading of the poem, in which <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3b.1;</mentioned> is an adverb and 3b-4b associated with 5a-9b instead of 1a-3a as here, see &howlett1974;, 6-7; Howlett&rsquo;s reading is discussed below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch3r350;.</p></note> The poem&rsquo;s first four lines are used to state the theme, that men ought to worship God, and explain in general terms why this worship is due: <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0700" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3b.1; &copyOfno.3b.2; &copyOfno.3b.3; &copyOfno.3b.4;, / &copyOfno.4a.1; &copyOfno.4a.2;, &copyOfno.4b.1; &copyOfno.4b.2;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0700">as he, the eternal Lord, created the beginning of each of wonders</gloss> (3b-4); the last five lines expand on this point by recounting the actual order in which the physical manifestation of these wonders was completed: first God created the heavens, then the earth for men. As Hupp&eacute;, Bloomfield, and Schwab have noted, this two-part structure echoes contemporary ideas about the dual nature of creation: a <socalled>first</socalled> creation in which God produced the eternal and spiritual ideal and a <socalled>second</socalled> in which the temporal and physical aspects of this original ideal were realised (&huppe1968;, 129-131; &bloomfield1962;, 42-43; &schwab1983b;, 23).</p>
     <p id="CH3.160" n="3.18">In Robinson&rsquo;s stricter sense of the term, variation is confined almost entirely to the last five lines of the poem. As I have argued elsewhere (&odonnellforthcoming;), &ch; changes tone significantly at the end of 4b. In the first four lines, the poem&rsquo;s theme and rationale are stated in a relatively spare and straightforward fashion: in the traditional reading (see &sect;&nbsp;&ch3r130; and n., above), the two clauses making up the first section show an adverbial relationship (the second clause explains why we should do as the first commands), have different subjects, and employ verbs that differ in sense, number, tense, and perhaps person. Even the numerous references to God in these lines are not strictly speaking syntactically apposite, but vary either in case or in their association with different aspects of the Godhead: the first epithet in the poem, <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0770" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0770">Guardian,</gloss> 1b, is accusative singular and refers to God the Father; the second, third, and fourth references, <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0780" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.2a.1;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0780">Creator,</gloss> 2a, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.2b.2;</mentioned>, 2b, and <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0790" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3a.2;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0790">Father of glory,</gloss> 3a, are all genitive singular but modify nouns describing different parts of God&rsquo;s person and work. Indeed the only true example of syntactically apposite variation in the first four lines of the poem is found in 3b-4a, where the nominative singular pronoun <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3b.2;</mentioned>, 3b, and the nominative singular noun phrase <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0800" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.1; &copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0800">eternal Lord,</gloss> 4a, have the same referent and serve as subjects for the same singular finite verb (in the following citation, loosely appositive forms are in italic type; strictly appositive terms are in bold; superscript letters are used to group apposite elements):</p>

See also &fry1979a; and, for objections to Fry&rsquo;s method, &miletich1983;.</p></note> In some, more controversial, formulaic analyses, as much as 100% of the poem is said to be paralleled by poetic formulae or systems found elsewhere in the Old English corpus (see &fry1975; and &fry1979a; but cf. the objections in &miletich1983;). As Fulk indicates, this highly formulaic structure and use of poetic language go together: many formulae make use of poetic words, and participation in common formulae is no doubt responsible for the preservation of otherwise archaic terminology in poetry long after such words have fallen out of colloquial use in prose (&fulk1992;, 265-268).</p>
     <p id="CH3.200" n="3.22">The heavy use of poetic and formulaic diction in &ch; is significant for two reasons. In the first place, the poem is among the earliest recorded examples of sustained vernacular verse in any Germanic language (&stanley1995;, 139). While the evidence of later texts suggests that much of the poem&rsquo;s language belongs to a traditional poetic register, this traditional register is, in the case of several words and most if not all formulae, first attested in the &hymn; itself.<note id="CH3.NOTE.130" n="11"><p><socalled>Attested for the first time</socalled> in this context means <socalled>earliest appearance in the surviving written record.</socalled> Other Old English texts showing these terms may be as old as or older than &ch;, although they are found in later (usually much later) witnesses. Thus Green cites &Wid; (known from the late tenth-century Exeter Book) for <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> (&green1965;, 503). <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> and <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> are also found in the late tenth-century Vercelli Book text of the &Dream; (but not in the related &RuthCr;, a perhaps eighth-century runic text).</p></note> Thus while most scholars assume that C&aelig;dmon is drawing on and adapting a pre-existing Anglo-Saxon poetic tradition in his work, his poem is also very often our earliest evidence of this tradition&rsquo;s existence.<note id="CH3.NOTE.135" n="12"><p>Careful statements of the consensus position can be found in &robinsonfc1985;, 29-59, esp. 30 and n. 9; &stanley1995;, 139-140. &opland1980;, 95-97, argues that Anglo-Saxon traditional poetic diction may in fact date only from the seventh and eighth centuries.</p></note></p>
     <p id="CH3.210" n="3.23">But the traditional poetic vocabulary and formulae of &ch; are significant for another reason as well: as Bede&rsquo;s account suggests and as the internal evidence of its Germanic vocabulary makes clear, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem, while one of the earliest attested examples of traditional Germanic poetry, is not itself directly representative of the earliest Germanic tradition. As a Christian poem, &ch; by definition adapts, rather than seamlessly continues, the original pre-Christian tradition from which it presumably draws its vocabulary and formulae. This can be seen nowhere more clearly than in the poem&rsquo;s epithets for God. Two of the four terms for God in the last five lines of the poem, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0920" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>, have their origins in pre-Christian Germanic lordship terminology (&stanley1995;; &green1965;); a third, <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0910" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned>, is commonly used in a non-religious sense to describe a <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0910">keeper</gloss> or <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0920">guardian.</gloss> One of these terms, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned>, is attested for the first time in any Germanic language in &ch; (&green1965;, 287); a second, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>, is found earlier only in cognate form in Wulfila&rsquo;s Gothic translation of the Bible (the implication of &green1965;, 503).</p>
     <p id="CH3.220" n="3.24">This means that our earliest knowledge of these terms, and hence the formulae in which they are found, is from their secondary, metaphorical, usage in Christian poetry. In describing God as a <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned>, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned>, and <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>, C&aelig;dmon is at best comparing the Christian deity to concepts traditionally applied to Germanic heroes and leaders; at worst, his terminology may consist of little more than dead metaphor, tags already so conventional as to be more or less drained of any symbolic force. Either way, neither the &hymn; nor most of the subsequent Old English poetic tradition gives us direct access to the precise connotations this pre-Christian vocabulary may have had for early Anglo-Saxon audiences. As Stanley points out, only twenty-two of the approximately 15,500 occurrences of <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0930" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> in the Old English corpus are intended in the secular sense of <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0930">lord, ruler, chief</gloss> (&stanley1995;, 138); a similarly effective Christianisation is also seen in the other Germanic languages. Green notes that most examples of traditional Germanic lordship and <foreign lang="LAT">comitatis</foreign> terms such as <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> and <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> in the cognate languages survive in Christian contexts, in most cases, indeed, in contexts that can be traced to centres of Anglo-Saxon missionary work or influence (&green1965;, 286-287).</p>
     <p id="CH3.230" n="3.25">Traditionally, this Christianisation of traditional Germanic poetic language and formulae has been attributed directly to C&aelig;dmon and his <socalled>school</socalled> (e.g. &stanley1995;, 139-140; &robinsonfc1985;, esp. 30 n. 9). Most accounts of the poem&rsquo;s composition and reception assume, therefore, that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s initial audiences would have found his use of pre-Christian terms such as <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned>, and <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0940" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned> daringly novel. As &smithah1978; suggests (15):</p>
     <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0160">
      <p>...[I]n C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s time when Northumbria had been converted to Christianity for only half a century these phrases belonging to Christian poetry could scarcely have become conventional, as they certainly were in later Old English; on the contrary, the poem represents the beginnings of such a diction and its freshness and originality must have been felt a generation or more after its composition; no mere assembling of clich&eacute;s would have called for inspiration, divine or otherwise.</p>
     </quote>
     <p id="CH3.235" n="3.26">Whether C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse really had this effect on contemporary audiences is open to doubt, however. While the poem does contain some of the first recorded examples of presumably traditional Germanic terminology in the new non-traditional Christian sense, nothing in Bede&rsquo;s account of its initial reception, or indeed in the use of this terminology in the poem itself, suggests that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s text was valued primarily for the novelty of its diction. As we shall see below (&sect;&nbsp;&ch3r240;), Bede&rsquo;s own praise of the poem concentrates on its sweetness, order, and propagandistic value; the praise he puts more indirectly in the mouths of Hild and her counsellors is primarily concerned with its smoothness, propriety, and faithfulness to its sources. No one in Bede&rsquo;s chapter comments on C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s role in the Christianisation of previously pagan poetic diction; the &hymn; itself applies its supposedly novel vocabulary without any obvious recognition of the freshness of its invocation of God as a traditional Germanic lord.<note id="CH3.NOTE.140" n="13"><p>This lack of attention to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s role in the supposed conversion of Germanic tradition is all the more surprising given Bede&rsquo;s emphasis elsewhere in the &he; on the process by which pagan monuments, rituals, and feasts were adapted to Christian use or overthrown. See, for example, his account of Gregory&rsquo;s letter to Mellitus (I. 30), and the account of the conversion of King Edwin in which the chief priest Coifi is shown destroying pagan temples (II. 13). In Bede&rsquo;s introduction to Gregory&rsquo;s letter, he suggests that the advice to take advantage of pagan monuments and customs demonstrated the Pope&rsquo;s eagerness <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0290" lang="LAT">erga saluationem nostrae gentis</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0940">for the salvation of our race.</gloss></p></note> Opland has suggested that &ch; is important because it demonstrates how an Anglo-Saxon <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0300" lang="ANG">scop</mentioned> can be not <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0170">the praise-poet of a lord, but... a praise-poet of the Lord</quote> (&opland1980;, 116). It is difficult, however, to imagine a less vehement vehicle for such a message.</p>
     <p id="CH3.240" n="3.27">The strongest evidence against the traditional reading of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem as a bold Christianisation of an earlier pagan Germanic tradition lies in the &hymn; itself, which seems to show no recognition of its supposedly seminal function. &ch; is not the poem to turn to to discover what it is like to feel the loss of a recent pagan heritage or to exult in the recognition that the new religion can provide its adherents with heroes as significant and dynamic as those celebrated in the old songs. If C&aelig;dmon is responsible for introducing terms like <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0970" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> in a religious sense, then he manages to rededicate this vocabulary with remarkable ease and lack of self-consciousness. He may describe God in terms appropriate to the Germanic hero, but nothing in his poem suggests that he is using these words in anything other than the stereotypical sense they acquire in later Old English Christian translations and prayers. His use of <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0960" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned> in 1b and 7b does contain some sense of <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0960">protector</gloss> or <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0970">guardian.</gloss> His description of God the Father as <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> and <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> in 4a, 8a, and 9b, however, shows no evidence that C&aelig;dmon actually saw Him in terms of a traditional Germanic leader.<note id="CH3.NOTE.150" n="14"><p>In addition to the evidence from Anglo-Saxon England cited here and below, it is useful to compare &ch; to the admittedly much longer 1970&rsquo;s musical <title level="m">Jesus Christ Superstar</title> (&lloydwebberandrice1993;), a work in which similarly striking (and <socalled>vernacular</socalled>) diction is used to refer to God. In contrast to &ch;, where traditional Germanic terminology is used in what can at best be described as an ornamental fashion, however, the <socalled>contemporary</socalled> language of <title level="m">Jesus Christ Superstar</title> is central to the musical&rsquo;s conceit.</p></note></p>
     <p id="CH3.250" n="3.28">Just how little emphasis C&aelig;dmon places on the pre-Christian and Germanic connotations of the epithets he chooses can be seen when the poem is compared to two passages of approximately similar length from poems in which tension between pre-Christian and Christian world views is at issue. The Song of Creation in &Beo; (ed. &kiernan1999; [Edition]; trans. &bradley1982;), a frequently mentioned analogue to &ch; (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch2x320;), for example, uses the ambiguity inherent in Old English poetic diction and formulae to emphasise the distance between the full Christian knowledge of world history shared by the poet and his audience and the far more limited world view available to the pagan characters of his poem. This is particularly true of the Song&rsquo;s double ending: after a relatively orthodox account of creation in 92-98, Hro&eth;gar&rsquo;s <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0310" lang="ANG">scop</mentioned> goes on to what a Christian audience would initially understand as a brief resume of prelapsarian life and the Miltonesque introduction of the <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0320" lang="ANG">feond</mentioned> responsible for bringing <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0180">death into the world, and all our woe</quote>:</p>

In forcing his audience to re-evaluate its understanding of the precise moment at which the song of Hro&eth;gar&rsquo;s <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0360" lang="ANG">scop</mentioned> ends, the &Beo; poet emphasises the distance between contemporary Christian understanding of world history, in which the significance of the underlying biblical history is recognised, and that of his pagan characters, who are doomed to repeat the original error unknowingly.

     <p rend="noindent">In this passage, only slightly longer than &ch; and perhaps based on an originally contemporaneous text, Christ is portrayed in terms strongly reminiscent of those used by the Whitby poet for God the Father: he is described as the <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0370" lang="ANG">frean mancynnes,</mentioned> <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0370">Lord of mankind,</gloss> 33b; <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0380" lang="ANG">dryhten,</mentioned> <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0380">Lord,</gloss> 35b; <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0390" lang="ANG">geong h&aelig;le&eth;,</mentioned> <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0390">young man/hero,</gloss> 39a; <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0400" lang="ANG">ricne cyning,</mentioned> <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0400">powerful King,</gloss> 44b; and <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0410" lang="ANG">heofona Hlaford,</mentioned> <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0410">Lord of the heavens,</gloss> 45a. But while the terminology is similar, the force of the language is completely different: the power of the passage in the &Dream; depends on our recognition of the double meanings inherent in the traditional poetic terms.

Vigorous and single-minded, he strips himself for battle and a kingly victory. The action is entirely his, an eager sacrifice; there is no question at this point of his being nailed to the cross. Instead he climbs to embrace it (40-2). It is pre-eminently an act of dominant free will by a prince confident of victory. With the agony transferred to the cross, Christ can sensibly be seen to rule from the gallows.</p>

     <p id="CH3.270" n="3.30">The seeming lack of interest in the metaphorical force of the C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vocabulary is echoed in Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase; and account of its reception in the &he; (IV. 24 [ed. &colgraveandmynors1969;]). At no point in his chapter does Bede imply that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse was noteworthy for anything other than its metrical quality, organisation, and propagandistic success (see also &abraham1992;, 334). The chapter&rsquo;s opening lines suggest that Bede saw C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry as praiseworthy primarily because it was well constructed, scripturally based, never frivolous or impious, and very effective in leading men to turn their thoughts to heaven. His description of Hild and her counsellors likewise, portrays them as being struck more than anything by the poet&rsquo;s musicality and ability to translate accurately into well-formed verse. When they give him their first commission, it is for a translation of scripture or religious doctrine into <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0460" lang="LAT">modulationem carminis</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0980">metrical form.</gloss> After they accept him into the monastery and set him on his programme of translation, they appear to be most impressed by his poetry&rsquo;s <socalled>sweetness</socalled>:</p>

     <p id="CH3.280" n="3.31">Slightly more ambiguous evidence is provided by Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase;. As we have seen above (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch3r160;-&ch3r190;), the epithets C&aelig;dmon uses in his original Old English are all relatively common in a religious sense in subsequent vernacular poetry. They are in the case of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> in particular, moreover, associated with stereotypical Latin translations. In Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase;, however, the majority of these <socalled>traditional</socalled> epithets are either omitted or translated using Latin words carrying no sense of the original connotations. Thus <mentioned rend="postemendation" id="CH3.MENTIONED.0990" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned>, <quote id="CH3.QUOTE.0280">the standing term for <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0520" lang="LAT">dominus</mentioned></quote> in the Germanic languages (&green1965;, 298), is not translated in Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase; using the expected equivalent. Instead it is paraphrased using <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0530" lang="LAT">Deus</mentioned>, <gloss target="CH3.MENTIONED.0990">God,</gloss> on its first occurrence in 4a and omitted altogether in the translation of 8a. The pre-Christian lordship term, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>, 9b, similarly, is omitted in Bede&rsquo;s translation, which nevertheless retains the second word in the half-line, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.2;</mentioned> (translated by <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0540" lang="LAT">omnipotens</mentioned>)&mdash;an adjective which, Robinson demonstrates, was common in both pagan and Christian contexts (&robinsonfc1985;, 34-38). Only in the case of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned> does Bede translate C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s traditional Germanic terminology using a Latin word with equivalent connotations, albeit even then on only one of the noun&rsquo;s two occurrences: in 7b he translates <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.7b.1; &copyOfno.7b.2;</mentioned> with <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0550" lang="LAT">Custos humani generis</mentioned>, a paraphrase that retains the connotations of the original vernacular text quite closely; in 1b, however, Bede&rsquo;s translation of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.1; &copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned> by <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0560" lang="LAT">auctorem regni caelestis</mentioned> abandons the sense of guardianship implicit in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s original formulation.</p>
     <p id="CH3.290" n="3.32">There are several reasons why Bede might fail to translate C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s supposedly most novel epithets with either their stereotypical Latin equivalents or forms showing similarly striking connotations. One, implied by the traditional understanding of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s pioneering role in the Christianisation of Germanic poetic diction, is simply that the epithets themselves were too new, too unusual, and perhaps even too daring at the time Bede set to work (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch3r200;). In this view Bede avoids translating <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> or <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> with a Latin term showing a similar sense of lordship either because the traditional equivalency between these words and Latin <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0570" lang="LAT">dominus</mentioned> had yet to be established or, because, like Bishop Wulfila who consistently avoids the cognate of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> (but not, interestingly, that of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>) in his Gothic translation of the Bible, he found the comparison too extreme for his intended readership (on Wulfila, see &green1965;, esp. 265-269).</p>
     <p id="CH3.300" n="3.33">A second possibility, however, is simply that Bede did not consider C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s specific choice of epithets to be all that significant. In this view, Bede&rsquo;s failure to use what later material suggests to be the usual Latin translation for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vocabulary comes not from any qualms about its novelty or suitability but rather Bede&rsquo;s sense that this diction was not a crucial aspect of the vernacular poem&rsquo;s success or structure.</p>
     <p id="CH3.310" n="3.34">The first piece of evidence suggesting that this second possibility might be true lies in his treatment of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned> in 1b and 7b. The fact that Bede uses a Latin equivalent with similar connotations to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s original on one of the word&rsquo;s two occurrences demonstrates that he did not consider <emph>this</emph> form to be too bold for his intended audience; the fact he does not use similar Latin terms both times, however, suggests that he did not see its repetition in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Old English to be particularly important to the poem&rsquo;s form or meaning. In this light, the omission of an equivalent for <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned> and the translation of <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.4a.2;</mentioned> as <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0580" lang="LAT">Deus</mentioned> rather than <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0590" lang="LAT">Dominus</mentioned> might as easily be a sign that Bede did not find C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s specific diction to be very important as evidence that he found it too bold.</p>
     <p id="CH3.320" n="3.35">The second piece of evidence suggesting that Bede was not overly concerned with C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s original vocabulary involves his treatment of poetic variation in the &paraphrase;. As I have argued elsewhere (&odonnellforthcoming;), Bede&rsquo;s translation, while treating C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s supposedly novel diction in an inconsistent fashion, pays extremely close attention to his use of appositive variation: in paraphrasing the text, Bede removes or rephrases every single example of repetition among syntactically apposite elements in the poem.<note id="CH3.NOTE.155" n="15"><p>&cavill2002; argues that Bede also removes <quote>structural alliteration</quote> from the poem (11). As Cavill notes, however, Bede is less consequential in his treatment of this aspect of Old English poetic practice: while Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase; does not use alliteration as a structural principle, it does reproduce some alliteration for what Cavill describes as <quote>decorative purposes</quote> (12).</p></note> This policy has its greatest effect in the last five lines, where C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vernacular shows the most ornamental repetition (see &sect;&nbsp;&ch3r140;, above). The original text&rsquo;s two, more-or-less synonymous verbs, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.5a.3;</mentioned> and <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.8b.2;</mentioned>, are collapsed into a single Latin form, <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0600" lang="LAT">creauit</mentioned>. The five syntactically apposite nominative pronouns and noun phrases, likewise, are reduced to two-and-a-half: in translating 5 to 9, Bede retains the first nominative reference in each clause (<mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3b.2;</mentioned> [translated as <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0610" lang="LAT">qui</mentioned>], 5a; <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1b.2;</mentioned> [translated as <mentioned id="CH3.MENTIONED.0620" lang="LAT">Custos</mentioned>], 7b) but eliminates their poetic variants, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.6b.1; &copyOfno.6b.2;</mentioned>, 6b, <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.8a.1; &copyOfno.8a.2;</mentioned>, 8a, and <mentioned lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9b.1;</mentioned>, 9b. In contrast, Bede&rsquo;s translation of the first four lines of the poem renders C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s relatively spare Old English nearly word-for-word. The only exception comes in the equivalent to 3b through 4a, where, significantly, Bede recasts the vernacular text in order to eliminate the only example of ornamental syntactic apposition in the Old English poem&rsquo;s opening lines.</p>

     <head id="CH3.6.HEAD">Conclusion</head>
     <p id="CH3.330" n="3.36">Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon is by far the most detailed contemporary non-fiction account of poetic practice to survive the Anglo-Saxon period. As Bede was not an eyewitness to the events he was recording, however, its greatest value to modern scholars lies in what it tells us about how C&aelig;dmon was understood by his near-contemporaries. Taken together, the evidence of the first two chapters suggests that, for Bede at least, C&aelig;dmon was a superbly accomplished vernacular poet who learned to sing in an unusual way. The evidence of this chapter, however, suggests that he was not in practice particularly aesthetically innovative. The evidence of the rest of the poetic corpus and cognate languages suggests that C&aelig;dmon was drawing on traditional Germanic language and forms in composing his &hymn;. But while the &hymn; represents a secondary development of this (presumably originally pagan) tradition, there is no evidence to suggest that C&aelig;dmon was himself responsible for the initial adaptation of pagan terminology to Christian ends. C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse shows very little self-consciousness about its supposedly novel formulations for God; Bede does not devote any special attention to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s use of formulae or poetic diction in either his translation or his account of the poem&rsquo;s initial reception. What Bede&rsquo;s account does suggest, however, is that C&aelig;dmon was a good technician. Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase; of the original vernacular pays close if negative attention to the rendition of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s use of ornamental apposition; his description of the poem&rsquo;s initial composition and reception suggests that C&aelig;dmon was valued by his contemporaries for his skill as a versifier.</p>
