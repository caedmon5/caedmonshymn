     <head id="CH6.1.HEAD">Introduction</head>
     <p id="CH6.010" n="6.1">Witnesses to &ch; can be divided into two main dialectal groups: Northumbrian and West-Saxon. Each of the poem&rsquo;s five recensions belongs to one or the other of these two main dialectal divisions, although, as &dobbie1937; demonstrated, the distinction is textually insignificant:  key recensional readings cut across dialectal lines, and copies of the &hymn; showing similar dialectal features need not show any other evidence of close textual affinity. This is particularly true of the two Northumbrian recensions: as demonstrated above (&sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch5x065;-&ch5x080;), the &eordu; is closer textually to the &wseorthe; and &wsylda; recensions than it is to the &naelda;. The dialectal similarity among the three West-Saxon recensions is similarly incidental: while two of the three appear to be descended from the same broad tradition, various minor and major differences suggest that each was translated independently from the Northumbrian (see further, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch6r52;-&ch6r54;).</p>
     <p id="CH6.020" n="6.2">The following sections discuss aspects of the language of the &hymn; as represented in the surviving witnesses. The emphasis throughout is on features that are significant for the determination of dialect or date. As in &ch4x;, above, references in this section are intended to be current and useful rather than historically exhaustive. More detailed studies of the language of the &hymn; exist. The &eorthan; is often discussed in general terms in studies of the dialect of the Old English &he; (see &grant1989; and &whitelock1963; for bibliography). The &aeldaShortReference; and &eorduShortReference; recensions are important sources for our knowledge of Northumbrian and, as a result, are frequently cited in dialectal studies and the standard grammars (e.g. &ross1937;; &campbell1991;; &hogg1992;; &bourns2001;). Witnesses to these recensions are also the subject of several self-standing studies and monographs, many of which deal in whole or in part with linguistic matters (e.g. &cavill2000;; &odonnell1996b;; &wuest1906;). Readers interested in a more detailed account of the language of the &hymn; are referred to these sources.</p>

    <div2 id="CH6.2">
     <head id="CH6.2.HEAD">Northumbrian features</head>
     <p id="CH6.030" n="6.3">Five witnesses to the &hymn;, belonging to two distinct recensions, show Northumbrian features. Two of the witnesses, &lx; and &mx;, are found in early manuscripts of Bede&rsquo;s Latin &he; and can be dated with relative certainty on palaeographic and internal grounds to the eighth century (see below, &ch4xAppendix;).<note id="CH6.NOTE.010" n="1"><p>Arguments against the authenticity of the &hymn; in these early manuscripts in &kiernan1990b; are unconvincing; see below, &ch4xAppendix; and &ch5xAppendix;.</p></note> Both contain copies of the &aelda;. The other three witnesses, &p1x; &brx; &dix;, contain copies of the &eordu;. These manuscripts are in continental hands ranging in date from &s12ex; through &s15ex;. As &odonnell1996b; demonstrated, all three derive from a single insular exemplar. While none represents the work of a scribe familiar with Old English, their evidence can be used collectively to help isolate readings from the original manuscript with which this version of the poem travelled to the continent.</p>
     <p id="CH6.040" n="6.4">In the material that follows, &mx; and &lx; are cited independently as appropriate. As the forms in &dix;, &p1x;, and &brx; are of no independent linguistic value, readings from the &eordu; are usually cited (under the siglum &eordux;) from the reconstructed text rather than from individual witnesses.<note id="CH6.NOTE.012" n="2"><p>A detailed defence of the reconstruction can be found in &odonnell1996b; and, in abridged form, in the textual introduction to this edition (&ch7xEordu;).</p></note></p>

In the case of the &ylda;, all surviving witnesses read a nonsensical dative plural <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.9a.3;</mentioned> (presumably the result of a misinterpretation of Northumbrian -<mentioned lang="ANG">u</mentioned> as -<mentioned lang="ANG">&umacr;</mentioned>) for expected accusative singular <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.9a.3;</mentioned>. In the &eorthe;, all three witnesses read nonsensical <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfep.4b.1;</mentioned> (nominative singular) for expected <mentioned lang="ANG">eor&eth;an</mentioned> (accusative or genitive singular), presumably reflecting, once again, a misinterpretation of an underlying exemplar in -<mentioned lang="ANG">u</mentioned> or -<mentioned lang="ANG">a</mentioned>.</p>
     <p id="CH6.530" n="6.53">Two further examples show more serious problems involving the likely misinterpretation of originally Anglian forms. The nonsensical &ylda; reading <mentioned rend="preemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfyl.8b.2;</mentioned> for expected <mentioned lang="ANG">teode</mentioned>, for example, is best explained, as Dobbie demonstrated, as a misinterpretation of Northumbrian <quote id="CH6.QUOTE.0030"><mentioned lang="ANG">tiad&aelig;</mentioned>, or a similar form,</quote> in the recension&rsquo;s original exemplar (&dobbie1937;, 39).

     <p id="CH6.540" n="6.54">Several other forms spread across the different recensions show sporadic non-West-Saxon spellings in individual witnesses. Germanic *<seg type="linguistic" subtype="phonemic">a</seg> before a nasal consonant and cluster, for example, appears in the early and Anglian spelling <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">o</seg> rather than expected West-Saxon <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">a</seg> in the early &eorthan; witnesses &nx; and &ox; in <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOfn.2b.3;</mentioned>, 2b, and more generally in <mentioned rend="postcorrection" lang="ANG">&copyOft1.7b.1;</mentioned> (&t1x; &nx; &ox; &cax; and all witnesses to the &eorthe;).
