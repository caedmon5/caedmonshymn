     <head id="CH4.1.HEAD">Introduction</head>
     <p id="CH4.010" n="4.1">&ch; is known to have been copied in twenty-one medieval witnesses. Of these, two have been destroyed and a third badly damaged: &tomlr; (&tor;) was destroyed during World War II; &cmlsr; (&cr;) was badly burned in the Cottonian fire of 1731, and the section containing &ch; completely destroyed; &bdmlr; (&bdr;) survives, but the copy of the &hymn; in the manuscript has been almost completely effaced by a corrector. Fortunately, however, only the erased text of &bdr; is lost to modern readers: a photographic facsimile survives of the page containing the &hymn; in &tor; (&faiderandvansint1950;, pl. iv) and a complete transcription of &cr; was made by Laurence Nowell in the mid-seventeenth century (&nmlr; [&nx;]).</p>
     <p id="CH4.020" n="4.2">The manuscripts of &ch; have not suffered from a lack of attention. Seventeen were described, transcribed, and edited by Dobbie in the late 1930s and early 1940s (&dobbie1937;; &dobbie1942;). The remaining four were subsequently identified, (very briefly) described, and transcribed in &humphreysandross1975;. The appearance of the &hymn; in specific witnesses or groups of witnesses has been the subject of several studies and most manuscripts have also been described to a greater or lesser extent in library catalogues or other works not primarily concerned with &ch; (see individual manuscript entries below for details). Black and white facsimiles of all known witnesses were published in &robinsonfcandstanley1991;, pll. 2.1-2.21. New transcriptions (print and CD-ROM) and, for most witnesses, digital colour facsimiles (CD-ROM only) are available in this edition.</p>
     <p id="CH4.030" n="4.3">The following section provides brief physical descriptions of all known witnesses to &ch;. In writing these accounts, I have concentrated primarily on describing the folio or folios upon which the &hymn; itself appears. While they are in most cases based on my personal examination of the manuscripts,<note id="CH4.NOTE.010" n="1"><p>In making this edition, I have personally consulted all witnesses to the &hymn; except the destroyed manuscripts &tor; and &cr;, &t1r; (undergoing conservation in the summer of 1998), and the late &sanmr;. I inspected the manuscripts of &ch; in June and July 1998, except for &brr;, which I consulted in the spring of 1994.</p></note> they are not intended to replace standard palaeographical descriptions. Bibliographic references too are meant to be useful rather than exhaustive. In citing secondary accounts, I have preferred significant and (where available) recent works to those of purely antiquarian interest or containing only passing or unsupported references to the manuscript in question. This is particularly true of disputes about the number, identification, or dating of hands. Scholars interested in the history of such arguments can in most cases reconstruct the bibliography from the works cited here, particularly &dobbie1937;.</p>

The most likely figure is probably 231 or 331 folios.<note id="CH4.NOTE.080" n="8"><p>As these figures suggest, there is considerable confusion surrounding the original number of folios in &cr;.

Subsequent, post-fire, estimates have ranged from less than 231 folios (&ker1990;, 233) to Dobbie&rsquo;s estimate of <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0150">more than 350 leaves</quote> (&dobbie1937;, 24).</p><p>The confusion appears to have its origins in two separate mistakes in &wanley1705;. First of all, Wanley appears to confuse folio and page numeration in his description of the manuscript&rsquo;s contents. In locating the incipits for items I through XII, Wanley references specific pages. For items XIII and XIV, however, he changes to folio numbers:</p>

	  </quote>
	  <p rend="citation">(&wanley1705;, 229).</p>
	  <p>As his last page-number reference (at the bottom of the first column on p. 219) is to <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0160">Pag. 349</quote> and his first folio reference (at the top of the second column on p. 219) is to <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0170">fol. 349,b,</quote> it seems likely that it is the folio count that is incorrect. For <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0180">fol. 349,b,</quote> therefore, read <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0190">page 350,</quote> for <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0200">fol. 351,</quote> read <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0210">page 351.</quote> This provides a low estimate of 176 folios for the manuscript as a whole (implicit in &ker1990;). The confusion also explains the high estimate of <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0220">more than 350 leaves</quote> mentioned by &dobbie1937;.</p>
	  <p>In addition to confusing folios and pages, however, Wanley also appears to have miscounted in his 1705 catalogue. As Torkar argues, the easiest way of reconciling Wanley&rsquo;s published and unpublished paginations is to assume that the printed catalogue has accidentally dropped 100 pages from its count (for a detailed explanation, see &torkar1981;, 49-60). After collating the surviving fragments against &nr; and various pre-fire descriptions of &cr;, moreover, Torkar concludes that the error arose in the Old English Bede (&torkar1981;, 50-60, especially 58-60).</p></note> <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0230">244 &times; 177 mm</quote> (Writing Surface: <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0240">207 &times; 144 mm,</quote> single column of <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0250">27 long lines, except ff.&nbsp;35, 36, 39 and Add.

This seems inconsistent with a) the layout of the manuscript (it assumes that the scribe of the &memoranda; used a much larger top margin on f.&nbsp;128v than elsewhere), b) the strong similarities between the smaller script of the &hymn; and the larger script of the &memoranda;, and c) the convincing argument in &kiernan1990b; concerning the &memoranda; scribe&rsquo;s approach to compiling f.&nbsp;128v:</p>
	  <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0395">
	   <p>The Moore scribe apparently collected the marginalia in his exemplar and deposited them all in a heap at the end of his manuscript.</p>
	   <p>Thus, instead of inserting C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s &hymn; as a marginal note on the same page as Bede&rsquo;s Latin paraphrase (fol. 91r), as the other Anglo-Saxon manuscripts of the Latin text do, the Moore scribe makes an endnote of our first English poem. He also apparently gathered together and alphabetized three rather specialized glosses from the margins of his copy-text.... And, of course, he combined the marginal chronological notes into what scholars have been calling the Moore Memoranda (52-53).</p>

This view, however, ignores differences in the context within which each text is found. Although the two passages are written with similar space between the lines, the Old English text of the &hymn; is written in a clearly more compact script, such as, indeed, would be suitable to a gloss. Characters are bunched together, decorative features like finials and spiked descenders are reduced in prominence, and there is less attention devoted to preserving contrasts in descender lengths or between thick and thin strokes. The main Latin text is copied in a much larger and more careful script. The relative length of the <socalled>descenders</socalled> on <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0440">the letters <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">f</seg>, <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">p</seg>, <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">r</seg>, and <seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">s</seg></quote> and <quote id="CH4.QUOTE.0450"><seg type="linguistic" subtype="graphemic">g</seg>,</quote> moreover, is irrelevant. The two groups of letters have completely different types of <socalled>descenders</socalled>; one would expect such different ratios to arise in different types of writing by the same scribe in different scripts. Given the large number of similarities between the two scripts, it is more than reasonable to conclude that the two texts have been written by the same scribe. See also &parkes1982;, 5, and, for details of the fourth scribe&rsquo;s work, 7 and 11.</p></note> No &sr; connects the two texts.</p>
