     <head id="CH2.1.HEAD">Analogues to the C&aelig;dmon story</head>
     <p id="CH2.010" n="2.1">Scholars have devoted an immense energy to tracking down analogues to Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life and work. Approximately forty-five so-called analogues to the C&aelig;dmon story, and, with some overlap, perhaps fifteen to the &hymn; itself,<note id="CH2.NOTE.010" n="1"><p>A comprehensive count is impossible. This is due both to the flexibility with which the term <socalled>analogue</socalled> is used in the secondary literature, and to the fact that scholars frequently propose analogues in passing in books and articles on topics otherwise seemingly unrelated to seventh- and eighth-century Anglo-Saxon England. Summaries of the most commonly cited parallels are reproduced below, &ch2rAppendix;.</p></note> have been discovered since 1832 when Palgrave first pointed out similarities between Bede&rsquo;s chapter on C&aelig;dmon and the <title lang="LAT" level="m">Prefatio</title> and <title level="m">Versus de poeta</title> associated with the <xref doc="notee" from="HELIAND">Old Saxon <title lang="LAT" level="m">Heliand</title></xref> (&palgrave1832;, 341). While the initial grounds for the hunt were, as Palgrave&rsquo;s examples suggest, classical and medieval Europe, twentieth-century researchers in particular have ranged far more widely, finding parallels among the aboriginal cultures of Australia and North America, the Fiji Islanders, the Xhosa of Southern Africa, the lives of the English romantic poets, and Hindu and Muslim tradition. The much smaller number of potential analogues to the &hymn; itself has tended to come from cultures with which the Anglo-Saxons had close contact. These include an Old High German prayer, a Celtic creation poem, and various prayers and offices of the Anglo-Saxon church. The two main exceptions to this last trend are both found in the context of analogues to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration: the 96th <title lang="ARA" level="m">Sura</title> of the <title lang="ARA" level="m">Qur&rsquo;&amacr;n</title>, which was recited by Mohammed during his first revelation, and <title id="CH2TITLE0010" lang="XHO" level="m">Ulo Thixo Omkulu, ngosezulwini</title>, the <title corresp="CH2TITLE0010" level="m">Great Hymn</title> of Ntsikana, a nineteenth-century Xhosa preacher and religious leader.</p>
     <p id="CH2.020" n="2.2">The search for analogues often has been conducted with more enthusiasm than rigour. The idea that parallels to the C&aelig;dmon story might be found in cultures far removed from medieval Europe was first argued in
 a brief note by Aurner (&aurner1926;, 536), and, more analytically, in a subsequent essay by Pound. Pound&rsquo;s observation that <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0010">[i]llustrative material</quote> paralleling C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life and work <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0020">might be multiplied almost indefinitely</quote> (&pound1929;, 239) appears to have been understood as a challenge by subsequent generations of scholars. In addition to discovering closer or more distant parallels to the C&aelig;dmon story in numerous and unexpected quarters, analogue researchers have also managed to produce a variety of partial analogues to individual elements and motifs: the passing of the harp in the <foreign lang="LAT">conuiuium</foreign>, for example, for which parallels have been found in the passing of the <foreign lang="LAT">citharam</foreign> at a wedding feast in the twelfth-century Latin prose <xref doc="notee" from="HEREWARD"><title lang="LAT" level="m">De gestis Herwardi Saxonis</title></xref> (&anderson1977;, 3-4); the passing of a cup in the <xref doc="notee" from="BEOWULF">feast scenes in &Beo;</xref> (&osborn1989;, 16); and the <xref doc="notee" from="VOLSATHATTR">passing of the <foreign id="CH2.FOREIGN.0005" lang="NON">vingull</foreign> or <gloss target="CH2.FOREIGN.0005">ossified horse&rsquo;s penis... wrapped in cloths</gloss> in the Old Norse <title lang="NON" level="m">Volsa thattr</title></xref> (&osborn1989;, 16).</p>
     <p id="CH2.030" n="2.3">It is easy to underestimate the importance this research.<note id="CH2.NOTE.020" n="2"><p>See for example the unwarrantedly sarcastic response to &aurner1926; in &klaeber1927;. Aurner&rsquo;s article, which implies that parallels to the C&aelig;dmon story might be found in literature around the world also provided the initial inspiration for the important discussion of the wide dissemination of apparent analogues to the C&aelig;dmon story in &pound1929;&mdash;an article published, ironically enough, in the Kl&aelig;ber <foreign lang="DEU">Festschrift</foreign>.</p></note>  But the exhaustive hunt for analogues to Bede&rsquo;s story has not been without value. While the search was begun by scholars like Palgrave who, impressed by the mythic quality of the chapter on C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration, sought to demonstrate its lack of authenticity either by finding Bede&rsquo;s source or by demonstrating that its details were so commonplace as to hardly merit consideration as legitimate historiography, subsequent studies have tended to be more agnostic towards C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s historical existence.<note id="CH2.NOTE.040" n="3"><p>See, among numerous studies that accept the possibility of a historical C&aelig;dmon, the otherwise quite different work in &stanley1995;; &frank1993;; &frantzen1990;; &opland1980;; &magoun1955;. Modern exceptions to this agnosticism concerning C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s historicity include &isaac1997; and &vonsee1983; see also &cavill2002;, pp. 2-5, for a brief discussion. Few if any modern scholars appear to accept the <socalled>miracle</socalled> of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration at face value. See above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x070; and note.</p></note> Rather than seeing the analogues as an opportunity for testing Bede&rsquo;s accuracy, these studies instead have tended to see the presumed parallels from world culture as an opportunity for establishing the folkloric, psychological, anthropological, or cultural contexts within which Bede (or in some cases subsequent generations) understood his subject&rsquo;s experience and significance. By uncovering and publishing numerous more-or-less similar stories, poems, and motifs from around the world, analogue scholars have established a substantial body of comparative material that can be used to assess the cultural and archetypal influences within which C&aelig;dmon and Bede composed their respective works.</p>
     <p id="CH2.040" n="2.4">One result of this assembly of material has been the perhaps surprising discovery that very few of the supposed analogues to Bede&rsquo;s chapter actually mirror his account all that closely: after a search spanning nearly two centuries, no sign of the many similar traditions so often and so confidently predicted in early analogue studies has yet to appear. The key feature of the story in most modern readings, the gift of poetic utterance by a dream visitor, does show numerous more-or-less similar parallels in cultures around the world. Beyond this central feature, however, the analogous stories collected thus far tend to show more differences from than similarities to Bede&rsquo;s account.</p>
     <p id="CH2.050" n="2.5">The extent to which the <socalled>analogues</socalled> fail to parallel C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story in any great detail was demonstrated most convincingly by Lester. Setting out to <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0030">test the supposition that the C&aelig;dmon story is paralleled widely elsewhere</quote> (&lester1974;, 225), Lester broke Bede&rsquo;s account of the poet into twenty-four <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0040">essential</quote> features against which most of the then-known analogues could be compared (228):</p>

     <p id="CH2.060" n="2.6">The results of this comparison were surprising. Of the fourteen analogues Lester examined, only one, the story of Mohammed&rsquo;s Call, agreed with Bede&rsquo;s account in more than half these features&mdash;and even then only for a total of fifteen out of the possible twenty-four (63%). No other analogue agreed with the C&aelig;dmon story in even half the features of Lester&rsquo;s typology. The four next most similar stories (&hallbjorn;, &heliand;, and the stories of &valmiki; and &dunstan;) agreed in nine points each (38% congruence); the sixth most similar story (that of the sixth-century Muslim poet &abid;) showed eight points of similarity (33%); the seventh and eighth (&monkOfMelrose; and &godric;), seven (29%); and the remaining four, five points (21%) or less:</p>

     <p id="CH2.070" n="2.7">The differences between these supposed analogues and Bede&rsquo;s account are not trivial. While a majority agree with C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story in four main points&mdash;that the subject was asleep immediately before receiving his gift (67%), that the gift itself involved the appearance of one or more visitors (83%), that he is instructed to sing or recite (83%), and that the verse is in the poet&rsquo;s own language (83%)&mdash;several other significant aspects are found in few if any of the parallels Lester examined. C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s great age and low status, for example, are combined in no other story. While &valmiki;, the sage to whom the Sanskrit <title lang="SAN" level="m">Ramayana Epic</title> is traditionally ascribed, is old, he does not have low status: his great age, indeed, is presented instead as a means of indicating, along with his wealth, high social position, and reputation for wisdom, the reason why he was found to be particularly suited for the commission (see &lester1974;, 229). Parallels to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s initial refusal to sing, likewise, are found in only two of the proposed analogues: &dunstan; and &mohammed;. In only one tale, that of &mohammed;&rsquo;s Call, does the protagonist request guidance in choosing his subject matter or recite an explicitly religious text about creation. In only five stories does the inspiration come to a subject who is said explicitly to lack any skill in traditional poetic genres (&hallbjorn;, &heliand;, &monkOfMelrose;, &mohammed;, and &abid;).</p>
     <p id="CH2.080" n="2.8">In contrast to Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon, a large number of other analogues portray their subject, often a younger man, as actively seeking out inspiration from his visitor, engaging in deliberate consciousness-altering exercises, or otherwise encouraging the development of his poetic abilities (analogues showing one or more of these elements, some identified after Lester&rsquo;s article, include the stories of &abid;, the early twentieth-century Turkish poet &sabit;, &hallbjorn;, and &halfdan;). The subjects about which these protagonists ask or are asked to sing likewise differ greatly. In one case, that of &abid;, the request for assistance is for inspiration in composing a revenge poem; in other examples, poets are taught to compose tragedies (&aeschylus;), Latin hymns (&dunstan;, &godric;), or praise poems in honour of a great poetic predecessor (&hallbjorn;). Finally, Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration appears to be unique in the nature of the test C&aelig;dmon is asked to undergo in order to prove his legitimacy: I am aware of no other analogue in which the protagonist is asked to demonstrate his skill by composing a new song to a text of his examiners&rsquo; choosing without reconsulting his muse.</p>
     <p id="CH2.090" n="2.9">It is possible to quibble with some of Lester&rsquo;s typological categories. He occasionally collapses what might be considered distinct attributes of the C&aelig;dmon story into a single feature: the requirement that the story have a subject who <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0060">sings God&rsquo;s praise in his sleep in verses he has never heard,</quote> for example, might as easily be counted as three separate requirements as one. Lester also omits aspects of the story that subsequent studies have treated as being more significant&mdash;the sex of the person to whom the subject of the analogue reports the story of his inspiration, or, perhaps more difficult to define, whether the inspiration is represented as the beginning of a scripture, school, or poetic tradition. Including these categories in the table or applying Lester&rsquo;s typology to analogues discovered since 1974 or missed in his article, however, does not significantly change the results of his original demonstration. No subsequent work has fared better than those discussed by Lester in finding analogues that emphasise areas in which previous generations of scholars were least able to find legitimate parallels: i.e. a subject who is both old and without previous training or desire to perform; an encounter in which the gift of poetry is presented as an external, compulsive, and unwanted demand; or a first performance that is rapidly followed by a test in which the poet is asked to compose additional material in the same vein by human examiners.</p>
     <p id="CH2.100" n="2.10">The failure of the analogue-hunters in their search for close parallels to Bede&rsquo;s chapter on C&aelig;dmon is significant in its own right. As Ward has shown in relation to Bede&rsquo;s miracle stories, differences between Bede&rsquo;s work and broadly similar stories in other sources can be as revealing as the similarities (&ward1976;, 74). While the absence of direct or even very close parallels to Bede&rsquo;s story of C&aelig;dmon suggests that he was not simply adapting a tale he heard elsewhere or cutting his account out of folkloric whole cloth, the fact that so many stories from around the world agree with his account at one or more points provides us with a considerable basis for separating what is common in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story from what is unique or unusual. This allows us both a better appreciation of what Bede considered to be important in the story, and, just as significantly, a demonstration of what Bede could have done with his tale had he wanted to bring it more closely into line with other stories of similar types of inspiration known to him or current elsewhere in world literature.</p>

      <p id="CH2.110" n="2.11">The most instructive place to begin such a comparison is with the story that, perhaps surprisingly, shows the closest similarities to Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration: that of Mohammed&rsquo;s Call as told in the <title lang="ARA" level="m">Qur&rsquo;&amacr;n</title> and associated Islamic tradition. Because of the importance of this analogue and its reliance on sources written in languages falling outside those most commonly cited in Anglo-Saxon studies, I quote the story at length from a modern biography of the Prophet (&lings1983;, 43-45):</p>
      <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0070">
       <p>[As Mu&hdotbelow;ammad rose in esteem among the people of Mecca,] he began to experience powerful inward signs, in addition to those of which he had already been conscious.... The immediate result of these visions was that solitude became dear to him, and he would go for spiritual retreats to a cave in Mount &Hdotbelow;ir&amacr;&rsquo; not far from the outskirts of Mecca.... During these few years it often happened that after he had left the town and was approaching his hermitage he would hear clearly the words <q>Peace be on thee, O Messenger of God,</q> and he would turn and look for the speaker but no one was in sight, and it was as if the words had come from a tree or a stone.</p>
       <p>...[O]ne night towards the end of Ramadan, in his fortieth year, when he was alone in the cave,... there came to him an Angel in the form of a man. The Angel said to him: <q>Recite!</q> and he said: <q>I am not a reciter,</q> whereupon, as he himself told it, <q>the Angel took me and whelmed me in his embrace until he had reached the limit of mine endurance. Then he released me and said: <q>Recite!</q> I said: <q>I am not a reciter,</q> and again he took me and whelmed me in his embrace, and again when he had reached the limit of mine endurance, he again released me and said: <q>Recite!,</q> and again I said <q>I am not a reciter.</q>  Then a third time he whelmed me as before, then released me and said:</q></p>

       <p>He recited these words after the Angel, who thereupon left him; and he said; <q>It was as though the words were written on my heart.</q>  But he feared that this might mean he had become a jinn-inspired poet or a man possessed. So he fled from the cave, and when he was half-way down the slope of the mountain he heard a voice above him saying: <q>O Mu&hdotbelow;ammad, thou art the Messenger of God, and I am Gabriel.</q>  He raised his eyes heavenwards and there was his visitant, still recognisable but now clearly an Angel, filling the whole horizon, and again he said: <q>O Mu&hdotbelow;ammad, thou are the Messenger of God, and I am Gabriel.</q>.... Finally the Angel turned away, and the Prophet descended the slope and went to his house. <q>Cover me! Cover me!</q> he said to [his wife] Khad&imacr;jah as with still quaking heart he laid himself on his couch.... [W]hen the intensity of his awe had abated he told her what he had seen and heard; and having spoken to him words of reassurance she went to tell her cousin Waraqah, who was now an old man, and blind. <q>Holy! Holy!</q>, he said. <q>By Him in whose hand is the soul of Waraqah, there hath come unto Mu&hdotbelow;ammad the greatest N&amacr;m&umacr;s, even he that would come unto Moses. Verily Mu&hdotbelow;ammad is the Prophet of this people. Bid him rest assured.</q>  So Khad&imacr;jah went home and repeated these words to the Prophet, who now returned in peace of mind to the cave, that he might fulfil the number of days he had dedicated to God for his retreat. When this was completed, he went... [to greet] the old and the blind Waraqah... and Waraqah said to him: <q>Tell me, O son of my brother, what thou hast seen and heard.</q> The Prophet told him, and the old man said again what he had said to Khad&imacr;jah. But this time he added: <q>Thou wilt be called a liar, and ill-treated, and they will cast thee out and make war upon thee...</q> Then he leaned towards him and kissed his forehead, and the Prophet returned to his home.</p>
	<p>The reassurances of Khad&imacr;jah and Waraqah were followed by a reassurance from Heaven in the form of a second Revelation....</p>

	</quote>
	<p>After the first Messages had come there was a period of silence, until the Prophet began to fear that he had incurred in some way the displeasure of Heaven.... Then at last the silence was broken, and there came a further reassurance, and with it the first command directly related to his mission:</p>
	<quote>
	 <p><hi rend="oblique">By the morning brightness, and by the night when it is still, thy Lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee, and the last shall be better for thee than the first, and thy Lord shall give and give unto thee, and thou shalt be satisfied.

So for the orphan, oppress him not, and for the beggar, repel him not, and for the bountiful grace of thy Lord, proclaim it!</hi></p>

      <p id="CH2.120" n="2.12">The similarities between this story and that of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration have been remarked upon by a number of scholars (e.g. &thundy1989;; &vonsee1983;; &magoun1955;, 58, n. 21). The two stories&rsquo; narratives follow almost identical patterns until after the protagonists&rsquo; first performances. Their subject is an apparently illiterate man<note id="CH2.NOTE.045" n="4"><p>In Bede no direct mention is made of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s literacy or illiteracy, though he is usually assumed on historical grounds to be illiterate; in the <title lang="ARA" level="m">Qur&rsquo;&amacr;n</title>, Mohammed is frequently described as the <foreign id="CH2.SOCALLED.0010" lang="ARA">umm&icirc;,</foreign> <gloss corresp="CH2.SOCALLED.0010">unlettered,</gloss> prophet, though there is debate as to the precise implications of the term in context and the extent of the Prophet&rsquo;s actual literacy or illiteracy; see &armstrong1992;, 88.</p></note> who is asked to perform in some way by an unannounced and (initially at least) unrecognised interlocutor. Both men are approached by their visitor while they are in a particularly receptive state: while dreaming in the case of C&aelig;dmon; during a meditative retreat in that of Mohammed. The interlocutor repeats his request several times in both stories, and is rebuffed at least once by each man&mdash;although Mohammed, who refuses to recite three times, is far more steadfast than C&aelig;dmon, who asks for advice on what he should sing immediately after his interlocutor&rsquo;s second request. In both cases the conversation ends with the interlocutor indicating the material that is to be performed. In the story of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration, this takes the form of the subject the herdsman is to sing; in that of Mohammed&rsquo;s Call, Gabriel provides the actual text Mohammed is to recite as well. Both protagonists conclude their performances by committing this first text to memory. Finally, both men tell the story of their vision to a close associate as soon as they are able (C&aelig;dmon tells his reeve; Mohammed his wife), who then passes the story on to a person of higher authority for authentication (the Abbess Hild and her counsellors in the case of C&aelig;dmon; the wise and old Waraqah in that of Mohammed).</p>
      <p id="CH2.130" n="2.13">The differences between the stories, however, are as significant as their similarities. Where in Bede&rsquo;s account C&aelig;dmon is certain almost immediately that his vision represents a true and exceptional gift from God, Mohammed is, initially at least, far less sure and requires frequent reassurance: first from the archangel Gabriel on the slopes of &Hdotbelow;ir&amacr;&rsquo;, later from his wife Khad&imacr;jah and her cousin Waraqah (both indirectly via Khad&imacr;jah and later in person), and finally from God himself via the next two revelations. The reception the subjects receive after their initial revelation is also quite different. As Bede notes, C&aelig;dmon is accepted into Hild&rsquo;s monastery and set to work composing sacred songs and scriptural translations after a brief test of his abilities. His success as a propagandist, moreover, is equally immediate: Bede reports twice that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s singing excites men from sin and towards good works, and notes how even the monks assigned to teach him the sacred books were enchanted by the beauty of his song. Mohammed, in contrast, while initially able to gather a small group of disciples, and, of course, ultimately the leader of a significant religious, political, and military force, nevertheless both keeps his gift relatively quiet in the first few years of his revelation and suffers ill-treatment, exile, and war as predicted by Waraqah.</p>
      <p id="CH2.140" n="2.14">The most important difference between the two tales for our purposes, however, lies in the precise nature of the gift each man receives in his vision. In C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s case, the gift is that of poetic inspiration: his visitor commissions him to compose a song about creation rather than to perform a pre-existing text, and nothing about C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s subsequent career suggests he ever needs to consult with his interlocutor again: he adds more material of his own invention to his original song when he wakes up the morning after his vision, and he is able for the rest of his life to translate <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0090" lang="LAT">quicquid ex diuinis litteris per interpretes disceret,... post pusillum uerbis poeticis maxima suauitate et conpunctione conpositis in sua, id est Anglorum, lingua</quote>, <quote corresp="CH2.QUOTE.0090">whatever he learned from the holy Scriptures by means of interpreters,... quickly... into extremely delightful and moving poetry, in English, which was his own tongue</quote> without additional help (&he; IV. 24 [ed. and trans. &colgraveandmynors1969;]). As noted above (&sect;&nbsp;&ch2r070;), this emphasis on C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s ability at composition is reflected in the test set by Hild and her counsellors: while they question him about his dream and visitor, they accept him into the monastery after he proves himself able to compose a new poem on a subject of his examiners&rsquo; own choosing.</p>
      <p id="CH2.150" n="2.15">In Mohammed&rsquo;s case, in contrast, the gift received is that of revelation. While Mohammed&rsquo;s work does require considerable effort and interpretative skill, he is himself not responsible for the content of the messages he recites. It is indeed a tenet of Islam that the Prophet does not invent his texts: Mohammed is told what he must say; his gift is the ability to understand what these (sometimes very hard to decipher) messages mean (Mu&hdotbelow;ammad ibn Ism&amacr;&lsquo;&imacr;l al-Bukh&amacr;r&imacr;, I. 3 as quoted in &lings1983;, 44-45):</p>
      <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0100">
	<p>Sometimes it [i.e. revelation] cometh unto me like the reverberations of a bell, and that is the hardest upon me; the reverberations abate when I am aware of their message. And sometimes the Angel taketh the form of a man and speaketh unto me, and I am aware of what he saith.</p>
       </quote>
      <p>As Hopkins has argued in an unpublished essay, moreover, Mohammed, in contrast to C&aelig;dmon, is not required by his closest associates to perform or produce additional revelations after he reveals the content of the first (&hopkins2000;). Waraqah&rsquo;s initial comments on the divine origin of Mohammed&rsquo;s first revelation come immediately after he hears of it&mdash;second hand&mdash;from Khad&imacr;jah. And unlike C&aelig;dmon, Mohammed must endure an initial dry spell: while a second reassuring message comes to him almost immediately (<title lang="ARA" level="m">Sura</title> 68), he is then forced to suffer through several years of silence before the revelations begin again in earnest with the 93rd <title lang="ARA" level="m">Sura</title>.</p>

      <head id="CH2.1.2.HEAD">Aldhelm and Ntsikana</head>
      <p id="CH2.160" n="2.16">The differences between Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration and the story of Mohammed&rsquo;s Call emphasise the extent to which Bede&rsquo;s real interest in the C&aelig;dmon story lies in his subject&rsquo;s ability to compose. But C&aelig;dmon is not only a poet to Bede; he is also a Christian and in Bede&rsquo;s eyes at least the best (if not necessarily the first, see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x220;) ever to turn his hand to the composition of religious verse in Old English. The origins of vernacular Christian verse are the subject of a number of other proposed analogues. None of these agrees with C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story on as many points as that of Mohammed&rsquo;s Call, although one, the story of Ntsikana, an early nineteenth-century Xhosa religious leader and poet, comes close, and a second, the story of Aldhelm, the Anglo-Saxon man of letters and C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s near contemporary, offers other useful points of comparison. Once again, however, the differences these tales show to the C&aelig;dmon story are as revealing as the similarities. In particular, Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon is unique in its emphasis on the lack of continuity between C&aelig;dmon and contemporary vernacular poets (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x340;). While all three stories touch to some degree upon what might be understood as the founding of a new school of Christian vernacular verse (though see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x220; and note), Bede&rsquo;s version goes to great lengths to distance C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s choice of subject and method of composition and performance from those of other singers mentioned in the story. In contrast, the stories of Aldhelm and Ntsikana depend on the reader recognising an essential connection between their subjects and the vernacular traditions their subjects adapt. Although, as argued below (&ch3x;), &ch; is, formally speaking, a very traditional Germanic poem, Bede devotes considerable attention in his chapter to suggesting that its composition and performance owe little if anything to the techniques and habits of earlier poets. Aldhelm and Ntsikana, on the other hand, are invariably portrayed as adapting existing techniques and forms for new Christian ends.</p>

       <p id="CH2.170" n="2.17">An influential seventh-century Anglo-Saxon bishop, Aldhelm has been described as <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0110">the first English man of letters</quote> (&lapidgeandrosier1985;, 1). He knew most of the leading political and ecclesiastical figures of his day, and had a profound effect on the development of English Latin literary life. He is the first Englishman known to have turned his hand to Latin poetry, and he remained an important influence on Anglo-Latin prose and verse style almost to the Conquest. He is, in Orchard&rsquo;s words, <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0120">perhaps the most important figure in the history of Anglo-Latin, indeed of Anglo-Saxon, literature</quote> (&orchard1994;, 1).</p>
       <p id="CH2.180" n="2.18">It is Aldhelm&rsquo;s claim as a potential rival to C&aelig;dmon for the title of the first recorded English vernacular religious poet, however, that most interests us. An approximate contemporary of the Whitby herdsman, Aldhelm is reputed to have composed a significant and well-loved body of vernacular verse. He is said by William of Malmesbury to have been a favourite of Alfred the Great, a king whose interest in and taste for vernacular poetry is well documented in contemporary sources; and he is reported by the same historian to have composed a <q>trivial</q> song that was still commonly sung in William&rsquo;s day (<title level="m">Gesta Pontificum Anglorum</title> [ed. &hamilton1870;], V. 190; trans. adapted from &opland1980;, 121. See above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x230;, for a caution about twelfth-century accounts of Anglo-Saxon composition):</p>

	 <p>Although fully instructed in literature, he [Aldhelm] did not neglect poems in his native language; so much so that there was never at any period anyone to equal him, as the book of Alfred (which I spoke about above) attests. He was able to create poetry in English, and to compose a song  and to sing or recite that in the appropriate manner. Finally, Alfred records that Aldhelm composed a trivial song, which is still sung among the people, adding the evidence which he gives to argue that so great a man undertook with reason things that might seem frivolous.</p>
	</quote>
       <p id="CH2.190" n="2.19">Unfortunately, and in contrast to C&aelig;dmon, no contemporary accounts (or identifiable examples) of Aldhelm&rsquo;s vernacular poetic production survive. One incident, however, is recorded in both William of Malmesbury&rsquo;s early twelfth-century <title lang="LAT" level="m">Gesta Pontificum Anglorum</title> and, in a slightly different and less detailed form, Faricius of Arezzo&rsquo;s late tenth-century <title lang="LAT" level="m">Vita S. Aldhelmi</title>. In this story, Aldhelm is said to have used his abilities as a vernacular poet to compose Old English songs or poems in order to entice the laity back into church for his sermon (Faricius leaves the genre and language of text unspecified in his <title lang="LAT" level="m">vita</title>, referring instead simply to Aldhelm&rsquo;s <foreign lang="LAT">eloquia</foreign>). Given the dates involved, the tale, if true, must have occurred at approximately the same time C&aelig;dmon received his vision (ed. &hamilton1870;, V. 190):</p>

	<p>The people at that time, being semi-barbarous and too little interested in divine sermons, used to run off home immediately after the mass had been sung. And so the holy man positioned himself in the way of those who were leaving on a bridge which connected the town and the country as if he were someone professing the art of singing. Having done this more than once he earned the sympathy and the attention of the people. Once he had gained that, by gradually inserting scriptural phrases between the light-hearted, he led the people back to sanity; if he had considered acting strictly and with excommunication, he would assuredly have accomplished nothing.</p>

       <p id="CH2.200" n="2.20">A second, in many details closer, analogue to the C&aelig;dmon story comes from nineteenth-century southern Africa. Ntsikana was a member of the Cira clan in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and famous among his people for his social accomplishments, including composing, singing, dancing, and divining. In the early years of the nineteenth century, however, he underwent a visionary experience that left him with the gift of prophecy and an ability to compose Christian religious hymns in the style of traditional Xhosa eulogistic verse. He became the leader of a small Christian congregation that became known for its use of his hymns in their services, one of which, <title id="CH2TITLE0020" lang="XHO" level="m">Ulo Thixo Omkulu, ngosezulwini</title> or <title corresp="CH2TITLE0020" level="m">Ntsikana&rsquo;s Great Hymn</title> (trans. &opland1980;, 118), Opland reports in the late 1970s still to be <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0150">perhaps the most popular hymn among Christian Xhosas today</quote> (&opland1977;, 63):</p>

       <p id="CH2.210" n="2.21">Our knowledge of the relevant aspects of Ntsikana&rsquo;s life come from two main sources. The moment of his actual inspiration is narrated by his son and disciple, William Kobe Ntsikana (<title lang="XHO" level="m">Imibengo</title>, 9; as trans. and quoted in &jordan1973;, 44-45):</p>
       <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0170">
	 <p>On the day that he was called by the Spirit, he had risen early and was leaning leisurely against the poles of his cattle-fold. When the sun rose, one of its rays smote him. Then he was heard calling to a boy who was attending the calves, <q>Do you see what I see?</q>  The boy said, <q>No.</q>  Three times he asked him, and still the boy said <q>No.</q>.... Then he went to a <foreign id="CH2.FOREIGN.0010" lang="XHO">mdudo</foreign> (dance), together with other people. But on this day, when he stood up to dance, the wind arose. At last he sat down. Then later on he stood up again to dance, and again the wind rose. Thereupon he ordered all those of his household to accompany him home. And when he came to the river, he washed off the red ochre. And they wondered what had befallen him....</p>
	 <p>On reaching home, he told them what had befallen him, and also that they must not listen to Nxele, who was misleading the people, but listen to this Thing that had entered him. <q>This Thing that has entered me enjoins that we pray, and that all must kneel!</q>  Thereafter he held divine service at all times, and he was wont to put on his kaross of leopard-skins, and read<note id="CH2.NOTE.050" n="5"><p>By <q>read</q> in this passage, we are to understand perform.

       <p rend="noindent">The story of Ntsikana&rsquo;s death comes from another source, the report to the Glasgow Mission society for 1823 by John Brownlee (as quoted in &opland1977;, 62):</p>
       <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0190">
	 <p>One of the strongest encouragements to Missions in this country, is the blessing which seems to have accompanied the labours of the late Mr. Williams [a European missionary active in Ntsikana&rsquo;s region until his death in 1818], not only among the people of the Institution, but also among those who were occasional visitors, of which I shall give you an instance. There is a Kraal of about 100 population, who, from the time of his death to my entrance into Caffreland (a period of nearly two years), were accustomed to meet regularly for worship, morning and evening, and to observe the Lord&rsquo;s day. The chief person of the Kraal, who conducted the worship, died about two years ago. He composed a hymn in their language, which they still sing in the worship of God. On the day of his death (of which he appeared to be fully aware), although he was able to conduct the worship, he spake as one on the brink of eternity, expressing a calm resignation to the will, and an humble confidence in the mercy of God. He appeared deeply interested in the salvation of his countrymen, and earnestly entreated those around him, to meet death in its most terrific form, rather than to give up the profession of religion.</p>

       <head id="CH2.1.2.3.HEAD">Aldhelm, Ntsikana, and C&aelig;dmon</head>
       <p id="CH2.220" n="2.22">The similarities of these stories to Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration are obvious. In the case of Aldhelm, the parallels are all to the middle part of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story, in which Bede discusses the result of his dream vision. While there is no suggestion that Aldhelm&rsquo;s poetic gifts are the result of any unexpected visitation&mdash;indeed, in the prologue to his <title lang="LAT" level="m">Enigmata</title>, Aldhelm specifically rejects the idea that his works are dream-inspired: <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0200" lang="LAT">nec/ In Parnasso procubui nec somnia vidi</quote>, <quote corresp="CH2.QUOTE.0200">I have not lain on Parnassus, nor have I seen dreams</quote> (lines 12-13, quoted in &orchard1994;, 136)&mdash;his religious verse and performance as recounted by William and (more indirectly) Faricius does resemble C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s post-inspiration poetry in a number of important aspects: it is of high quality, it has a strong effect on the behaviour of those who hear it, and, in its combination of vernacular and Christian elements, it is portrayed at least implicitly as having been responsible for the production of a new and unexpected vernacular genre.</p>
       <p id="CH2.230" n="2.23">The story of Ntsikana shows more thoroughgoing parallels to Bede&rsquo;s account. Like C&aelig;dmon, Ntsikana is a herdsman who develops his gifts as a Christian vernacular poet in response to a vision. Like C&aelig;dmon, Ntsikana&rsquo;s poetry proves to be extremely popular. And like C&aelig;dmon, Ntsikana dies like a saint. He is zealous in the performance of his religious duties and the defence of the faith, shows a concern for his own spiritual health and that of his co-religionists, and is said to have had a premonition of his death.</p> 
       <p id="CH2.240" n="2.24">For students of Old English, however, the most important aspects of Ntsikana&rsquo;s story lie in his obvious value as propagandistic icon and source of inspiration for those responsible for spreading the tale. Like Bede, Ntsikana&rsquo;s first biographers, Brownlee and Kobe Ntsikana, see their poet as both an example of the success of the initial Christian missionary activity in the Eastern Cape and a sign of the likely future success of their own efforts. Just as the association of C&aelig;dmon with Hild presumably serves as a further sign of her success and significance (although, as noted above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x186, the C&aelig;dmon story is in fact less emphatically tied to Hild or her monastery than is commonly argued), Brownlee introduces Ntsikana&rsquo;s story as further evidence of the on-going significance of the missionary work begun by himself and his predecessors in the Eastern Cape region. There is, moreover, a self-consciousness about both accounts of these poets. As Wieland has suggested, Bede, in his account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s death, models his narrative consciously or unconsciously on the traditional saint&rsquo;s life (&wieland1984;, 198):</p>
       <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0220">
	<p>There is more than overtones and influences&mdash;the Caedmon story <emph>is</emph> hagiography. Not only are there three miracles, namely the vision, the gift of poetry,<note id="CH2.NOTE.055" n="6"><p>See &sect;&nbsp;&ch1x270;, above, for a caution regarding this <socalled>miracle.</socalled></p></note> and the foreknowledge of death, but more important, Caedmon leads many other people to the <q>love of heavenly life,</q> thus fulfilling one of the most essential conditions for a human to become a saint. As a matter of fact, Caedmon used to be venerated as a saint at both Jarrow and Whitby, but is not now considered a saint by either the Anglican or Roman Catholic Church.<note id="CH2.NOTE.060" n="7"><p>Although C&aelig;dmon in Bede&rsquo;s account is clearly saint-like, there is no evidence to support Wieland&rsquo;s claim that C&aelig;dmon was <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0230">venerated as a saint</quote> anywhere before the Renaissance. For a discussion, see now &stanley1998;. Bede is also much more hesitant about C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s status than Wieland implies. See above, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch1x390;-&ch1x400;.</p></note></p>
       </quote>
       <p rend="noindent">In reporting Ntsikana&rsquo;s life and art, the European missionaries and their followers show themselves to be similarly influenced by hagiographic style and their conscious or unconscious recognition of the C&aelig;dmonian elements in Ntsikana&rsquo;s story. The description of his death in the biographies of Kobe Ntsikana and Makaphela emphasise the poet&rsquo;s saint-like willingness to die in God&rsquo;s service. Brownlee&rsquo;s report to the Glasgow Mission Society, likewise, presents Ntsikana at least generically as a new saint for a new mission. In the course of the twentieth century, moreover, the connection between the two became explicit. In his biography of the founder of the Bantu mission, Joseph Williams, Holt describes Ntsikana&rsquo;s great Hymn as <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0240">the first hymn in the Xhosa language, and [one that] will stand in relation to all subsequent literature in that tongue like Caedmon&rsquo;s Paraphrase to English</quote> (&holt1954;, 114).</p>
       <p id="CH2.250" n="2.25">Despite these superficial similarities with Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon, however, the stories of Aldhelm and Ntsikana remain very different. Perhaps the most significant of these differences lies in the relationship they establish between the new Christian vernacular poetry and the culture from which it emanates. As argued above (&sect;&nbsp;&ch1x340;), Bede appears in his account of &ch; to go to considerable lengths to establish the lack of any direct cultural continuity between C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Christian vernacular poetry and the more traditional, presumably secular, songs sung by his comrades at the <foreign lang="LAT">conuiuium</foreign>. In the stories of Ntsikana and Aldhelm, on the other hand, the connection between the new Christian verse and the secular culture that preceded it is essential to the poets&rsquo; appeal and legitimacy. Where Bede is careful in his account to stress the distance between C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training, skill, and style of performance and that of contemporary (and presumably traditional) Anglo-Saxon performers, William of Malmesbury in his account of Aldhelm at the bridge and the nineteenth- and twentieth-century historians and missionaries responsible for preserving the story of Ntsikana portray their subjects as accomplished traditional artists who turn their already-acquired skills with great success to the composition of Christian vernacular poetry in traditional styles.</p>
       <p id="CH2.260" n="2.26">This is most clearly seen in the case of Aldhelm, who is understood by his biographers to be an accomplished vernacular performer before he turned his hand to Christian material. In contrast to C&aelig;dmon, who fails to learn the trivial and idle songs of pre-Christian tradition even after his inspiration leaves him an accomplished vernacular poet, Aldhelm is said to have been famous for his abilities as a vernacular singer before he began composing Christian verse. William reports that Aldhelm&rsquo;s secular songs were still current in his own day, and, as Opland notes, presents the story of Aldhem&rsquo;s performance on the bridge in part as a way of mitigating this apparently damning skill by showing it being put to good use (&opland1980;, 121). Aldhelm&rsquo;s actual performance of this new Christian verse, moreover, differs from C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s in that it embraces, rather than eschews, the pre-Christian traditions. Where C&aelig;dmon distinguishes himself by performing in a different location, to a different audience, and in a different style from his contemporaries in the beer-hall, Aldhelm is said by William to adopt the traditional garb, location, and, in the beginning at least, repertoire, of the professional minstrel in his attempts to lure his parishioners back to church.<note id="CH2.NOTE.070" n="8"><p>Symbolically, indeed, it is no doubt significant that Aldhelm sits on a bridge that connects the [heathen and oral?] countryside to the [literate and Christian] town.</p></note></p>
       <p id="CH2.270" n="2.27">Ntsikana, for his part, lies somewhere between Aldhelm and C&aelig;dmon. On the one hand, the story of Ntsikana&rsquo;s Inspiration does involve a rejection of traditional culture. Having had his vision, Ntsikana finds himself unable to dance that night at the <foreign lang="XHO">mdudo</foreign>&mdash;though in contrast to C&aelig;dmon, who, Bede tells us, was accustomed to rise from the <foreign lang="LAT">conuiuium</foreign> whenever the harp approached, Ntsikana clearly expected to be able to participate in the dance and indeed tries twice before giving up. Unlike C&aelig;dmon, however, Ntsikana allies his Christian verse with previous pagan tradition by adopting the garb and style of the traditional poet for its performance. Opland describes Ntsikana&rsquo;s <title level="m">Great Hymn</title> as being <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0250">indistinguishable in style and technique from the <foreign lang="XHO">imbongi</foreign>&rsquo;s eulogies in praise of a chief</quote> and notes that the leopard-skin <foreign lang="XHO">kaross</foreign> is <quote>a manner of dress characteristic of the Xhosa <foreign lang="XHO">imbongi</foreign> or poet</quote> (&opland1977;, 64).</p>
       <p id="CH2.280" n="2.28">Taken together, these differences between Bede&rsquo;s story of C&aelig;dmon and the analogous accounts of other pioneering vernacular Christian poets suggest that Bede for his part was not all that interested in establishing an essential connection between traditional Germanic poetry and C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse. While C&aelig;dmon, Aldhelm, and Ntsikana are all analogous in that all three were significant poets whose work appears both to have appealed to their contemporaries and served a propaganda function in the development of their respective branches of the church, they differ in how their relationship to the preceding vernacular tradition is portrayed. For the biographers of Aldhelm and Ntsikana, the poets&rsquo; significance seems to be that they represent an appropriation&mdash;either of traditional poetic forms by the new Christian faith or of the new Christian faith as a subject matter for traditional poetic forms; for Bede, however, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s significance appears to be, culturally at least, far more revolutionary: rather than seeing him as a new model for poets trained in the old ways, Bede seems to have understood C&aelig;dmon as a replacement&mdash;as somebody who does not so much appropriate as obliterate the old ways of doing things.</p>

With the exception of the first texts performed by Mohammed and Ntsikana (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch2r100; and &sect;&nbsp;&ch2r210;), most of the proposed parallels are drawn from Old English, related Germanic languages, Irish, or the scripture and liturgy of the Anglo-Saxon Church.</p>

At the same time, however, it also shows a number of close similarities to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem, and to the &hymn;&rsquo;s last five lines in particular. The &GenA; passage deals with an identical subject, the building of heaven and earth, in the same order, and with several similarities of detail: as in &ch; the heavens are portrayed as something that must be raised, and the land as something that must be established. Stylistically, the &GenA; passage is similar to &ch; in its heavy use of nominal apposition: without being quite as languid as C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s text, which has five nominative singular references to God in its last five lines but only two verbs, the &GenA; passage, with three nominal references to God and three verbs in four and a half lines, is nevertheless far less active than the Beowulfian <socalled>Song of creation</socalled>, which has six finite verbs and two epithets for God in seven lines. Finally, the &GenA; passage is also formulaically far closer to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s work. Where the <socalled>Song of creation</socalled> in &Beo; showed no significant formulaic similarities with the &hymn;, the &GenA; creation passage shares three verbatim or near verbatim formulae: <mentioned lang="ANG">Her &aelig;rest gesceop</mentioned>, 112a; <mentioned lang="ANG">ece drihten</mentioned>, 112b; and <mentioned lang="ANG">frea &aelig;lmihtig</mentioned>, 116a. While the stylistic differences between these lines and &ch; may indicate that the two passages are not by the same author, their formulaic similarity suggests the existence of some connection. Given the wide distribution of &ch; in manuscripts of the &he; throughout Anglo-Saxon England and Anglo-Saxon-influenced centres on the continent, it is possible that the &GenA; poet had C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem in mind when he composed this section of his work.</p>

       <p id="CH2.360" n="2.36">In the case of &ch;, as Hieatt and Morland note, L&ouml;nnroth&rsquo;s typology appears to apply primarily to Bede&rsquo;s presentation of the &hymn; in the context of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vision. C&aelig;dmon, though not presented as a mystical sage, is nevertheless challenged to tell a second person (his dream visitor) about creation. The &hymn; itself does not enumerate the parts of creation, although it does set out, in a different order, a basic contrast between the heaven and earth in its two parts. The most significant differences between the &hymn; and the type scene pointed to by L&ouml;nnroth, however, lie in those very elements he considers most crucial to its definition: at no point does the &hymn; explicitly emphasise the <q>lowness</q> or <q>greenness</q> of the earth, and, perhaps most importantly, the text does not show the expected alliterative <mentioned lang="NON">i&ocedil;r&eth;/upphiminn</mentioned> formula.<note id="CH2.NOTE.130" n="11"><p>Hieatt proposes expanding L&ouml;nnroth&rsquo;s definition to include Old English poems that <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0490">do <emph>not</emph> contain the <mentioned lang="ANG">eor&eth;e / upheofon</mentioned> [i.e. <mentioned lang="NON">i&ocedil;r&eth; / upphiminn</mentioned>] formula</quote> on the basis that <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0500">most... examples [of the type scene as outlined in &lonnroth1981;], even those which do contain the key formula, do not have <emph>all</emph> possible features</quote> (&hieatt1985;, 494).

      <p id="CH2.370" n="2.37">A second field in which researchers have sought analogues to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem has been among the scriptural and liturgical texts associated with the Anglo-Saxon church. As was true of parallels to the story of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration, proposed scriptural and liturgical analogues for the poem itself range from brief lines or specific concepts and themes to larger analogues or sources for the text as a whole.</p>
      <div4 id="CH2.2.3.1">
       <head id="CH2.2.3.1.HEAD">Psalter</head>
       <p id="CH2.380" n="2.38">Similarities between &ch; and the Psalter were first pointed to by Blake, who argued that the &hymn;&rsquo;s debt to the Psalms encompassed both its general theme and its more specific choices of diction and epithet. Thus Blake argues that the two part structure of the &hymn;, in which C&aelig;dmon begins by summoning creation to praise God&rsquo;s greatness and concludes with <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0550">a description of what this greatness consists in,</quote> reflects Psalm 145, where <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0560">the opening five verses... are given over to the poet&rsquo;s praise of the Lord&rsquo;s greatness</quote> and the remainder of the Psalm to a recitation of the <q>forms this greatness takes</q> (&blakenf1962;, 244). Blake similarly suggests that the terms used to describe God and his creation may also have their origins in the Psalms, although the two texts differ in that the Psalter uses verbs for this purpose while &ch; prefers nominal epithets: C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s God is <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0570">a <mentioned lang="ANG">uard</mentioned>, a <mentioned lang="ANG">scepen</mentioned>, an <mentioned lang="ANG">eci dryctin</mentioned></quote>; in the Psalms God <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0580"><emph>guards</emph> the world, mankind and heaven;... <emph>created</emph> the world; and... <emph>lives throughout all ages</emph>.</quote> Blake also notes that the &hymn; and the Psalter agree in other specific choices of diction: C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.2a.2;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.2b.3;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3a.1;</mentioned>, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3b.3; &copyOfno.3b.4; / &copyOfno.4b.1;,</mentioned> and <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfae.5b.1; &copyOfae.5b.2;</mentioned> [Northumbrian &aeldaShortReference; and &wsylda; recensions only] can all be paralleled in the Psalms&rsquo; <mentioned lang="LAT">potentia</mentioned>, <mentioned lang="LAT">magnificentia</mentioned>, <mentioned lang="LAT">consilium</mentioned>, <mentioned lang="LAT">opera</mentioned>, <mentioned lang="LAT">mirabilia</mentioned>, and the very common tag <mentioned lang="LAT">filii hominum</mentioned> (&blakenf1962;, 245).</p>
       <p id="CH2.390" n="2.39">The fact that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s epithets are nominal rather than verbal is perhaps the most serious problem with this argument. On the one, hand, of course, the difference could be simply the result of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s adherence to the expectations of a different poetic tradition, even though Blake himself appears to rule this possibility out (245):</p>
       <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0590">
	<p>If it is accepted that C&aelig;dmon drew upon the psalms,... then we will have to reconsider C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s debt to heroic poetry.... I would suggest that the similarity in diction between C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Hymn and the extant OE. poetry need not imply that C&aelig;dmon borrowed from heroic poetry; it is quite possible that later poets borrowed from C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Hymn.</p>
       </quote>
       <p rend="noindent">On the other hand, however, it is difficult to explain why a poet supposedly so influenced by the Psalter would not only not try to reproduce its characteristic syntax more closely, but also develop as one of the major aesthetic features of his own poem an element&mdash;repetitive, appositional, nominal variation&mdash;not found in the passages Blake cites.</p>
       <p id="CH2.400" n="2.40">More recently, however, Biggs has suggested an attractive improvement to this argument&mdash;that is to say that the influence of the Psalter has been exerted not so much on C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s original text as on Bede&rsquo;s rendering of the poem in his Latin &paraphrase; (&biggs1997;, 304-308). Some of the specific evidence Biggs uses to make this argument is relatively weak, however. In particular his suggestion that Bede&rsquo;s translation attempts to bring the text of the &hymn; more in line with Psalm 113 <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0600">by disassociating the phrase <q>aelda barnum</q> from the creation of heaven</quote> for men (307) seems nonsensical. As Biggs notes elsewhere, Bede&rsquo;s &paraphrase; actually does the opposite (see esp. 308).

       <p rend="noindent">Since then, Hupp&eacute; and West have both proposed different versions of the Preface from the Office of the Mass. Hupp&eacute;, apparently building on Gollancz&rsquo;s discussion of similarities between the Preface and the opening lines of Genesis, suggests the Preface from the Gregorian Sacramentary as C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s model (text and trans. &huppe1968;, 125):</p>

       <p id="CH2.430" n="2.43">More recently, Stanley has proposed yet a third liturgical analogue for the opening lines of the &hymn;, the <title level="m">Benedicite</title> (<socalled>Song of the Three Children</socalled>), a canticle from Dan. 3,57 (ed. &weberandfischer1983;; trans. &anglicanchurchofcanada1997;) which was required at Lauds on Sundays in the Benedictine Rule (&stanley2002;, 3):</p>
       <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0800" lang="LAT">
	<p>[B]enedicite omnia opera Domini Domino laudate et superexaltate eum in saecula</p>
       </quote>

	<p>O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him for ever.</p>
       </quote>	
       <p rend="noindent">As Stanley notes, the syntax of the <title level="m">Benedicite</title> parallels one possible reading of the opening lines of the &hymn; in its earliest manuscripts, where, in the absence of any other nominative form, <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.3a.1;</mentioned> can be understood as the nominative plural subject of <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1a.2;</mentioned> (&stanley2002;, 3; the syntax of 1 through 3a is discussed below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch5x200;). The Canticle also follows, in very expansive form, a similar progression from heaven through earth to, in <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0805" lang="LAT">filiis hominum</quote>, the <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0810" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.9a.1;</quote> mentioned in 9a in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem:</p>

       <p id="CH2.440" n="2.44">As with the influence of the Psalter, it is difficult to decide whether these liturgical texts had their strongest influence on the vernacular &hymn;&rsquo;s composition or reception. On the one hand, there is very little evidence of a specific debt on C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s part to any. While the &hymn; agrees with these analogues in general terms of intent and theme, none of these areas of agreement are detailed enough to require us to assume C&aelig;dmon was basing his work directly on these specific liturgical antecedents. On the other hand, these general similarities of intent and theme are strong enough to associate C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s text almost unavoidably with such liturgical precedents in the minds of men and women who were familiar with them from daily use. If C&aelig;dmon did not have the Preface and Canticles in mind when he composed his &hymn;, it remains quite plausible to assume that his initial, religious, audiences would think of them immediately when they first heard his performance. In the case of Hild and her counsellors, this recognition appears to have resulted in the decision to set C&aelig;dmon to work translating <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0830" lang="LAT">seriem sacrae historiae</quote>, <quote corresp="CH2.QUOTE.0830">the whole course of sacred history.</quote> In the case of Bede, it may also show up in changes introduced into his &paraphrase; that bring the &hymn; more in line with the Psalms (see below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch5x270;). Interestingly, however, Bede&rsquo;s translation, which supplies a first person plural subject for its equivalent to <mentioned rend="postemendation" lang="ANG">&copyOfno.1a.2;</mentioned>, shows no obvious awareness of the similarity between &ch; and the <title level="m">Benedicite</title> (the relationship between the vernacular &hymn; and Bede&rsquo;s Latin paraphrase is discussed below, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch5x240;-&ch5x280; and &ch5xAppendix;).</p>

       <head id="CH2.2.3.3.HEAD">Genesis</head>
       <p id="CH2.450" n="2.45">Finally there is the biblical Genesis. Although &ch; is often discussed as though it were a paraphrase of the biblical book (e.g. &osborn1989;, 14), the direct influence is slight: the two works share individual ideas, but no particular section of Genesis appears to have served as a verbatim source for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poem. The idea that God created the heavens and the earth is found in Genesis 1:1, <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0840" lang="LAT">In principio creavit Deus caelum et terram</quote>, <quote corresp="CH2.QUOTE.0840">In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth</quote>; the suggestion that God then <quote corresp="CH2.QUOTE.0850">decorated</quote> (<quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0850" lang="LAT">teode</quote>) them, in Genesis 2:1 of the Vulgate: <quote id="CH2.QUOTE.0860" lang="LAT">Igitur perfecti sunt caeli et terra et omnis ornatus eorum</quote>, <quote corresp="CH2.QUOTE.0860">Thus the heavens and earth were completed and all of them decorated.</quote>  Missing, however, is the call to worship. Once again, the influence is likely to be more cultural than textual.</p>

     <head id="CH2.3.HEAD">Conclusion</head>
     <p id="CH2.460" n="2.46">The search for sources and analogues to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story (and to a lesser extent his &hymn;) has been one of the most tantalising and prolific areas of modern &ch; scholarship. Its greatest value to students of the poem, however, lies in its lack of success. Despite a hunt spanning two centuries, no unambiguous source or close and detailed analogue to either Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration or the &hymn; itself has been found. But while they do not supply us with the actual models used by Bede and C&aelig;dmon in composing their respective works, the <socalled>analogues</socalled> do provide us in their failure with something perhaps just as useful: a body of material against which the C&aelig;dmon story and poem can be compared. In the case of Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Inspiration, this comparison confirms the suggestion made above (&ch1x;) that Bede was, perhaps surprisingly, more interested in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s ability as a poet than in the origins of his gift. In that of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s &hymn;, on the other hand, the closest analogues suggest that the poem may have proved so successful with its initial monastic audiences because it blent traditional, formulaic, verse forms with a subject and approach that called to mind the most common liturgical prayers. Neither C&aelig;dmon nor Bede appear to have taken their texts from any other specific source; the fact that they remind us of so many others, however, may explain their popularity.</p>
