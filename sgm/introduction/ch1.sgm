     <head id="CH1.1.HEAD">Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon</head>
     <p id="CH1.010" n="1.1">Bede tells the story of the herdsman C&aelig;dmon and how he learned to sing in Book IV, Chapter 24 of the eighth-century &he; (ed. and trans. &colgraveandmynors1969;).</p>
     <p id="CH1.020" n="1.2">According to Bede, C&aelig;dmon was an old lay herdsman in the religious community of <term id="CH1.TERM.1" lang="ANG">Strean&aelig;shalch</term> (Whitby Abbey).<note id="CH1.NOTE.010" n="1"><p><term id="CH1.TERM.2">Whitby</term> is of Scandinavian origin and is first recorded as a place name in the <title level="m">Domesday Book</title> (&smithah1928;, 126). The Anglo-Saxon place name seems to have been <mentioned lang="ANG">Strean&aelig;shalch</mentioned>, a term Bede uses five times in the &he; (&hunterblair1985;, 9; for a more cautious view, &fell1981;, 82-85). The archaeology of the Saxon monastery is discussed in &peersandradford1943;, &cramp1976;, and &rahtz1976;. &platt1995; contains a recent popular discussion.</p></note> Although the singing of vernacular songs was a customary entertainment at the abbey, C&aelig;dmon himself never learned to sing, and, as a result, used to leave feasts before he could be called upon to do so. Having left such a gathering one night and returned to his stables, C&aelig;dmon fell asleep, whereupon he was addressed in his dream by <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0020">someone</quote> (Bede uses the Latin indefinite pronoun <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0020" lang="LAT">quidam</quote>), who asks him to sing for him. Explaining that he cannot, and, indeed, that he has just left the feast for that reason, C&aelig;dmon at first refuses. When the visitor insists, however, he gives in. Asking for a subject, he is told, <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0030" lang="LAT">Canta... principium creaturarum</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0030">Sing... about the beginning of created things.</quote> Almost immediately he begins his famous &hymn;, which Bede paraphrases in Latin for the benefit of his readers:</p>     
     <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0040" lang="LAT">
      <p>Nunc laudare debemus auctorem regni caelestis, potentiam Creatoris et consilium illius, facta Patris gloriae: quomodo ille, cum sit aeternus Deus, omnium miraculorum auctor extitit, qui primo filiis hominum caelum pro culmine tecti, dehinc terram Custos humani generis omnipotens creauit.</p>
     </quote>
     <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0040">
      <p>Now we must praise the Maker of the heavenly kingdom, the power of the Creator and his counsel, the deeds of the Father of glory and how He, since he is the eternal God, was the Author of all marvels and first created the heavens as a roof for the children of men and then, the almighty Guardian of the human race, created the earth.</p>
     </quote>
     <p id="CH1.030" n="1.3">When C&aelig;dmon awakes, he remembers everything that happened to him. He adds additional verses to his song and reports his vision and his new skill to his steward. Brought to the abbess, C&aelig;dmon describes his dream and sings his &hymn;. He is then assigned a sacred text to translate into verse overnight by way of a test. When he proves himself able to do so, he is ordered to join the religious community.</p>
     <p id="CH1.040" n="1.4">In the course of his training, it is discovered that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s gift extends to all holy subjects: upon hearing a passage of church history or doctrine, Bede tells us, C&aelig;dmon is able after a brief period to turn his lessons into <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0035" lang="LAT">carmen dulcissimum</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0035">most melodious verse.</quote> In addition to the &hymn;, his works are said to include poems on a wide range of subjects: the creation of the world, the beginnings of mankind, the biblical Genesis, the flight from Egypt and entry into the promised land, the incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord, the coming of the Holy Spirit, the teachings of the apostles, the terrors of hell, joys of heaven, and an account of God&rsquo;s gifts to mankind.</p>
     <p id="CH1.050" n="1.5">The last part of Bede&rsquo;s account concerns C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s exemplary life in the abbey, and, as Kiernan has pointed out, is less congenial to modern tastes (&kiernan1990a;, 158). Bede reports that C&aelig;dmon was humble and obedient to the monastic rule and extremely zealous in his work against those who were not. After an illness of fourteen days, he is said to die like a saint: able to predict the hour of his own death, C&aelig;dmon asks to be moved to the hospice in which the terminally ill are lodged even though his own condition seems anything but serious. He gathers his friends and servants around him and asks if they have any outstanding quarrels with him. Told that they do not, he prays briefly, asks for the Blessed Sacrament, and finally expires just before <foreign lang="LAT">nocturn</foreign>.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 id="CH1.1a">
     <head id="CH1.1a.HEAD">Bede&rsquo;s account and modern scholarship</head>
     <p id="CH1.060" n="1.6">Bede&rsquo;s account of the poet C&aelig;dmon is one of the most famous passages in Anglo-Saxon literary studies. Indeed, it is probably one of the few bits of Anglo-Saxon literary history known to anybody other than professional Anglo-Saxon scholars. The &hymn; commonly is anthologised in undergraduate textbooks, where it is accompanied invariably by some version of Bede&rsquo;s chapter as headword or footnote, often as an introduction to further discussion of Anglo-Saxon prosody, compositional practice, or the adaptation of traditional pagan poetic forms and vocabulary to Christian ends (e.g. &fergusonetal1996;, 1 and n.; &mitchellandrobinsonfc2001;, 220-225).</p>
     <p id="CH1.065" n="1.7">The story is also of the greatest importance to Anglo-Saxonists. Bede&rsquo;s account is one of very few surviving contemporary non-fiction references to Anglo-Saxon vernacular poetic composition, performance, and reception. It is also by far the most detailed. It is, if it is reliable, an extremely important source of information about the way in which early medieval vernacular poetry was composed, received, and appreciated. It can be used for assessing the applicability to early medieval society of theories of oral composition developed through the observation of twentieth-century cultures (e.g. &magoun1955;; &opland1980;, 106-120; &fry1981;). It gives us some insight into the patronage of vernacular poets by administratively important figures in the Anglo-Saxon church (e.g. &fell1981;, esp. 97-99; &leesandovering1994;; &stanley1995;, 134; &hunterblair1985;, 22-25). It is our principal evidence for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s role in the Christianisation of traditional Germanic poetic vocabulary and forms (e.g. &smithah1978;, 14-15; &robinsonfc1980;, 29-59; &green1965;, esp. 287). And perhaps most importantly, it tells us nearly everything we know about the life and work of one of the few Anglo-Saxon poets for whom any biographical information survives.<note id="CH1.NOTE.045" n="2"><p>The only biographical fact modern scholarship has been able to add to Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life and career concerns the probably Brittonic origins of the poet&rsquo;s name (&holthausen1934;, <title level="a">C&aelig;dmon</title>; &jackson1953;, 554). As a second school of critics have pointed out, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s name also may be related to that of Adam in exegetical tradition (e.g. &ohare1992;; &golden1969;; &strom1939;; &sarrazin1913;; the connection appears first to have been made in &palgrave1832;).</p></note> It is, assuming it is reliable, perhaps the single most important piece of contemporary literary history and criticism to survive the Anglo-Saxon period.</p>
     <p id="CH1.070" n="1.8">All this is true, however, only if Bede&rsquo;s account is reliable. And there are some things about it that, at first glance at least, do not seem all that promising. Most importantly, of course, there is the <socalled>miracle</socalled>: modern scholars on the whole do not believe that poets learn to compose accomplished verse overnight by the grace of God at the command of dream visitors&mdash;especially poets who appear, according to their biographers at least, to have had a complete ignorance of and even distaste for the tradition their work adapts.<note id="CH1.NOTE.050" n="3"><p>Disbelief in specific details of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s <socalled>miracle</socalled> as recounted in Bede is very common in modern discussions (opinions about the poet&rsquo;s existence are more evenly divided, see &cavill2002;, pp. 3-5, and &sect;&nbsp;&ch2.3;, below). The earliest expression of this disbelief seems to be &palgrave1832;. Representative recent examples (using a variety of different approaches and expressing varying amounts of disbelief) include &isaac1997;, 226-227; &biddick1994;, 31-32; &ohare1992;; &irvine1994;, 431-435; &kleiner1988;; &dumville1981;, 148. See also &magoun1955; for an influential attempt at explaining C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s initial reluctance to sing in very rational terms; the suggestion that C&aelig;dmon may have been suffering some kind of performance block appears to have been suggested first by Palgrave (see &palgrave1831;). Palgrave later came to doubt the historicity of C&aelig;dmon and his &hymn; entirely (see &palgrave1832;).</p></note> Then there is the problem of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training and methods of performance and composition. If scholars find it difficult to believe that untrained herdsmen can be turned overnight into technically accomplished poets through God&rsquo;s intervention, they have an especially difficult time believing in those whose training and careers appear to have more in common with monastic exegetes than traditional poets (e.g. &fritz1974;; &irvine1994;, 431-435) or seem to show parallels to other well-known stories of poetic inspiration around the world (see &ch2x;, below). Finally, there is the problem of religion. In addition to being a historian, Bede was a religious scholar and extremely pious man. It is possible that his praise for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;indeed, his account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life in general&mdash;was conditioned as much by his enthusiasm for the poet&rsquo;s cause as any real respect for his art (e.g. &irvine1994;, 431-435; &frantzen1990;, 143-144; &hunterblair1985;, 24-25). If Bede&rsquo;s chapter on C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life and work is to represent anything other than a lost opportunity at recovering a near contemporary account of the production and consumption of vernacular Anglo-Saxon poetry, we need to learn to read it in a way that allows us to recover its historical truth without offending either our own reason or Bede&rsquo;s understanding of the events he is recording (see most recently &rowley2003;).</p>
     <p id="CH1.080" n="1.9">Fortunately, this is not an impossible task, although it does require us to learn more about Bede&rsquo;s intentions in recording the C&aelig;dmon story and the intellectual framework within which he was working. For Bede&rsquo;s account is primarily an interpretative performance: it is less important for what it tells us about the technical details of how C&aelig;dmon came by his gift or composed his poetry than it is for what it tells us about how this apparently important Anglo-Saxon vernacular poet was understood by at least one intellectually significant Anglo-Saxon. Bede appears, for the most part, to have believed the details of his story as it is reported in the &he;. But he was not an eyewitness and does not suggest that he had the story from some specific, particularly knowledgeable informant. At times, indeed, he even appears to be uneasy with the implications of certain details of the story as it was told to him. What Bede is sure of, however, is his subject&rsquo;s significance and place in vernacular literary history: we are being told the C&aelig;dmon story because Bede considered C&aelig;dmon to be a great poet whose religious vernacular verse was without compare and who had a strong effect on those who heard it. Although it reports on an apparent miracle of God&rsquo;s grace and appears in a work of ecclesiastical history, the form and content of Bede&rsquo;s chapter in fact align it far more closely with the modern genre of literary biography. It is, indeed, the first of our <title level="m">Lives of the Poets</title>.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 id="CH1.2">
     <head id="CH1.2.HEAD">C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration as <socalled>miracle</socalled> story</head>
     <p id="CH1.090" n="1.10">Given modern interest in the mechanics of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration, perhaps the most surprising thing about Bede&rsquo;s chapter is the extent to which it is not about the <socalled>miracle</socalled> that made C&aelig;dmon a poet. The real story in IV. 24 is not <emph>how</emph> C&aelig;dmon learned to sing as much as it is how <emph>well</emph> he learned to do so and how this ability affected his life and the lives of those lucky enough to hear him. C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s actual dream occupies a relatively insignificant structural position in the story as a whole. As Abrahams has noted, the chapter is centred around the moment C&aelig;dmon joins the religious community at Strean&aelig;shalch after the performance of his second song: the sentence in which the abbess instructs him to become a monk straddles the story&rsquo;s geometric centre (&abraham1992;, 338-339); the infinitive with which she orders him to take up his vows, <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0050" lang="LAT">suscipere,</quote> falls, as the 450th word in the 899 word chapter, at its exact middle.<note id="CH1.NOTE.090" n="4"><p>Word counts are based on the text of &colgraveandmynors1969;. Not all versions of the chapter have exactly 899 words, though Colgrave and Mynors record very few significant recensional differences in their limited apparatus.</p><p>Specific word counts and percentages cited in this chapter are not assumed to have any recoverable intrinsic numerological significance; their citation is intended instead simply to show relative importance: sections involving more words or found in rhetorically prominent locations (such as the beginning, middle, or end of the passage) are assumed to have been more interesting or significant to the author or translator of the passage than those told in fewer words or found in less prominent places. A discussion of more formal numerological approaches to the &hymn; can be found below, &ch3xAppendix;.</p></note> As an event in C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life, moreover, the dream vision also occupies a correspondingly small portion of Bede&rsquo;s biography. While modern r&eacute;sum&eacute;s tend to concentrate on the exchange with the dream visitor and compress or even ignore everything after the account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training and career, Bede himself devotes fewer words to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s actual dream (196 words or 22% of the total) than to the description of his life in the monastery and death (318 words or 35%) or his interview, training, and career (222 words or 25%).<note id="CH1.NOTE.100" n="5"><p>Compare the summaries in &kiernan1990a;, 157-158; &magoun1955;, 49-50; and at the beginning of this chapter. The 509 word summary in &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch1r020;-&ch1r050; above was written long before the rest of the argument, although it was subsequently revised. It devotes approximately 35% (205 words) of its length to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s dream, 33% (194 words) to the poet&rsquo;s interview, training, and career, and 18% (132 words) to the discussion of the poet&rsquo;s life and death in the monastery. In this summary, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s admission to the religious community comes approximately 56% of the way through the narrative (he is ordered to <quote>join</quote> at the 328th word). Kiernan devotes 136 words or 41% of his 334 word summary to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s dream, 59 words or 18% to the poet&rsquo;s training and subsequent career, and 84 words or 24% to his subsequent life in the monastery and death. Magoun&rsquo;s version ignores everything after Bede&rsquo;s summary of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training and oeuvre, although he otherwise follows the proportions of the Latin text it translates relatively closely.</p><p>In the Old English translation of Bede, the dream is even less prominent than in Bede&rsquo;s original Latin. At 216 words in &miller1890;, it is only 17% of the chapter, 57% as long as the 377 word description of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training and oeuvre, and much less than half the length of the account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life as a monk and saintly death (474 words or 37% of the 1286 word chapter). It also allows C&aelig;dmon to take his monastic vows slightly early: in the Old English version, C&aelig;dmon agrees to become a monk by the 593rd word (46% of the way through).</p><p>It is possible to debate these figures: C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s interview with the abbess and her counsellors, for example, is at least in part concerned with the dream vision in that they ask him <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0060" lang="LAT">indicare somnium et dicere carmen, ut uniuersorum iudicio quid uel unde esset quod referebat probaretur</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0060">to describe his dream... and also to recite his song so that they might all examine him and decide upon the nature and origin of the gift of which he spoke</quote> before setting him his new commission. Even if one considers the initial interview with the abbess and subsequent tests to be part of Bede&rsquo;s account of the dream-vision, the story of the actual wonder ends up occupying no more space than the account of his life in the monastery and saintly death (i.e. 288 words or approximately 1/3 of the chapter&rsquo;s total length). For the purposes of this discussion, the sections involved are defined as follows (all page and line references to the text in &colgraveandmynors1969;): (i) Introduction (162 words), from <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0070" lang="LAT">In huius monasterio</quote> (p. 414, line [24]) to <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0080" lang="LAT">egressus ad suam domum repedabat</quote> (p. 416, line [2]); (ii) Vision (196 words), from <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0090" lang="LAT">Quod dum tempore</quote> (p. 416, line [3]) to <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0100" lang="LAT">Deo digni carminis adiunxit</quote> (p. 416, line [24]); (iii) Interview with Abbess, Training, and Description of Oeuvre (222 words), from <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0110" lang="LAT">Veniensque mane ad uilicum</quote> (p. 416, line [25]) to <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0120" lang="LAT">actionis excitare curabat</quote> (p. 418, line [22]); and (iv) Life in Monastery and Death Scene (318 words), from <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0125" lang="LAT">Erat enim uir</quote> (p. 418, line [22]) to the end of the chapter.</p></note> Even the chapter&rsquo;s introduction, in which Bede describes C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s piety, old age, ignorance of secular song, and quality of verse, but not the specific means by which the poet came by his gift, is, at 162 words, just under 83% as long as Bede&rsquo;s account of the actual dream vision.</p>
     <p id="CH1.100" n="1.11">This relative lack of interest in the mechanism by which C&aelig;dmon came by his gift is shared by the story&rsquo;s characters. When C&aelig;dmon is brought before the abbess and her counsellors, he is asked about his vision but tested on his compositional abilities. Although the examiners listen to his song and agree that his experience must represent a gift from God, they do not ask him to join their community until he proves himself able, in an act mimicking rather than directly testing his original experience, to compose a second poem on a subject of his human examiners&rsquo; choosing:</p>

They then read to him a passage of sacred history or doctrine, bidding him make a song out of it, if he could, in metrical form. He undertook the task and went away; on returning next morning he repeated the passage he had been given, which he had put into excellent verse. The abbess, who recognized the grace of God which the man had received, instructed him to renounce his secular habit and to take monastic vows.</p>

     <p id="CH1.110" n="1.12">C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s success as a propagandist, likewise, is never attributed to audience knowledge of either the origins of his gift or his wondrous first composition. Although Bede tells us twice that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse is able to turn men&rsquo;s hearts to despise the world, the context in which this claim is made on both occasions makes it clear that Bede considers this success to be a result of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s superb skill as a poet rather than the influence of his vision or unique quality of his first song. The first time Bede refers to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s effect on the hearts of men, his claim is preceded by a reference to the songs he composed in response to the religious instruction he received from Hild&rsquo;s counsellors after his vision:</p>
     <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0150" lang="LAT">

     <p>The second time, it is prefaced by a description of the poet&rsquo;s entire oeuvre:</p>
     <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0160" lang="LAT">

He also made songs about the terrors of future judgement, the horrors of the pains of hell, and the joys of the heavenly kingdom. In addition he composed many other songs about the divine mercies and judgements, in all of which he sought to turn his hearers away from delight in sin and arouse in them the love and practice of good works.</p>
     </quote>
     <p rend="noindent">Despite the unusual method by which C&aelig;dmon is said to have learned to sing, it is clear that for Bede, as, apparently, for the poet&rsquo;s contemporaries in Strean&aelig;shalch, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s most noteworthy characteristic was the quality of his verse.</p>

      <p id="CH1.120" n="1.13">This relative lack of interest in the actual <socalled>miracle</socalled> by which C&aelig;dmon came by his gift sets Bede&rsquo;s account of the poet apart from other tales of wonder told in the &he;.

At Strean&aelig;shalch, the vision was seen by an unnamed though particularly devoted nun in a distant part of the monastery who roused her companions to prayer long before the other nuns at the abbey were informed of the abbess&rsquo;s demise. At Hackness, the vision was seen by Begu, a nun of <quote>thirty or more</quote> years&rsquo; service, who similarly led her sisters in vigil until word of Hild&rsquo;s demise arrived from Strean&aelig;shalch. When the time of Hild&rsquo;s death was compared to that at which the nuns at Hackness saw their vision, it was discovered that the two events coincided exactly, a beautiful coincidence, Bede tells us, by which <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0170" lang="LAT">procuratum est diuinitus ut, cum illi exitum eius de hac uita uiderent, tunc isti introitum eius in perpetuam animarum uitam cognoscerent</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0170">it was divinely ordained that while some of them watched her [i.e. Hild&rsquo;s] departure from this life, others watched her entrance into the everlasting life of the spirit.</quote></p>

       <p id="CH1.140" n="1.15">According to Bede, Imma was a young retainer of King &AElig;lfwine. In the battle of Trent, at which &AElig;lfwine was killed, Imma was wounded and ultimately captured by allies of his lord&rsquo;s enemy, King &AElig;&eth;elred. Lying about his noble status for fear of his life, Imma was taken prisoner, and, after he recovered from his wounds, shackled. At this point, however, a miracle occurred. For no matter how many times his jailers tried to bind him, these bonds came undone whenever they left the room. Impressed by this wonder and discovering his true noble status, &AElig;&eth;elred&rsquo;s henchmen decide to sell their prisoner to a Frisian trader. Once again, however, the thane proves impossible to bind and Imma is allowed to go home to raise an appropriate ransom. Discussing events with his brother Tunna after his release, Imma discovers why he could not be shackled: Tunna, who was a priest, had thought that Imma had been killed at the battle of Trent and had, as a result, said masses every morning for the release of his brother&rsquo;s soul from purgatory. When the times of the masses are compared with the times at which Imma&rsquo;s bonds had come undone, it becomes clear that the masses had been responsible for loosening his shackles: by praying for the release of his brother&rsquo;s soul from purgatory, Tunna was able to free Imma from his temporal bonds. Imma goes on to tell many others about his experience and these men were inspired, in Bede&rsquo;s words,</p>

       <head id="CH1.1.1.3.HEAD">Comparison with the C&aelig;dmon story</head>
       <p id="CH1.150" n="1.16">The points of similarity between these stories and Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life and career are clear enough. In the case of the vision of Hild&rsquo;s soul, the most important elements include the characters&rsquo; insignificant administrative status, their association with Hild&rsquo;s monasteries, and the fact that they have a vision. In the case of Imma, the similarities include the indirect way in which Bede associates his character&rsquo;s story with the death of a historically more significant figure in the history of the English church, and the claim that Imma, like C&aelig;dmon, enjoyed considerable success as a Christian propagandist after his miraculous experience.</p>
       <p id="CH1.160" n="1.17">These superficial similarities, however, belie much more significant differences. While the nuns who watch Hild&rsquo;s soul ascend to heaven are like C&aelig;dmon in that they are administrative non-entities&mdash;Bede tells us the name and years service (but nothing else) of one and leaves the other nameless&mdash;they are unlike C&aelig;dmon in that their vision is intimately connected with Saint Hild. While the two nuns are presented as being themselves holy women, nothing in Bede&rsquo;s account suggests that this wonder could have happened only to them. Far more significant than their identities are the locations in which they experience their visions (far enough away from Hild&rsquo;s deathbed to prevent them from having immediate knowledge of the abbess&rsquo;s death, but close enough to receive word of it the next morning) and the fact that it was Hild&rsquo;s soul they saw ascending to heaven. The real miracle in this story is Hild&rsquo;s: any two pious individuals who happened to look up into the sky in the vicinity of Whitby Abbey at the appropriate time that night presumably would have served God&rsquo;s plan equally well.</p>
       <p id="CH1.170" n="1.18">C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story, however, has much less of an essential connection to Hild or even Whitby Abbey. Bede implies that C&aelig;dmon had his vision at Strean&aelig;shalch during Hild&rsquo;s administration and that it was Hild and her counsellors who questioned him and ultimately invited him to join their community.<note id="CH1.NOTE.105" n="6"><p>As Dumville has pointed out, Bede supplies no specific dates for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s career in the chapter and mentions by name neither the monastery in which he lived nor the abbess under which he served (&dumville1981;, 148). Nevertheless, it seems relatively certain that the poet, assuming he existed, began his career in Whitby during Hild&rsquo;s abbacy (i.e. sometime between 657 and 680) and died sometime between 679 and 684 (for modern discussion of arguments against C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s existence, see &cavill2002;, 3-5; &isaac1997;; and &vonsee1983;. The implications of this question for our knowledge of the &hymn; are discussed briefly below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch2x090; and &ch5xAppendix;). Bede&rsquo;s chapter begins by placing C&aelig;dmon <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0480" lang="LAT">In huius monasterio abbatissae</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0480">In the monastery of this abbess,</quote> a clear reference to Hild, the ascension of whose soul is described in the last paragraph of the preceding chapter, and Strean&aelig;shalch, the abbey in which Hild is said to have died. That his inspiration occurred during Hild&rsquo;s administration, moreover, is suggested by Bede&rsquo;s description of the morning after C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vision, in which C&aelig;dmon is taken by his reeve <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0490" lang="LAT">ad abbatissam</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0490">to the abbess,</quote> a reference almost certainly to Hild in as much as no indication of a change in abbess has been suggested since the chapter&rsquo;s opening lines.</p><p>The date of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s death is slightly more uncertain. The first line of the chapter following Bede&rsquo;s description of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s death (IV. 25) suggests that the fire at Coldingham Abbey happened <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0500" lang="LAT">his temporibus</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0500">about this time.</quote> While the E text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates this fire to 679, Bede appears to have thought it happened sometime after the death of the Abbess &AElig;bba, who was still alive in 681 (&plummer1975; 2: 258). The next specific date given in the &he; comes at the beginning of IV. 26, where Bede dates Ecgfrith&rsquo;s raid on Ireland <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0510" lang="LAT">Anno dominicae incarnationis DCLXXXIIII</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0510">In the year of our Lord 684</quote>. Taken together, these suggest an early obit of 679 (the E Chronicle dating of the Coldingham fire), and a late date of 684 (the next certainly datable event in Bede&rsquo;s history).</p></note> The miracle, however, is C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s. There is no intrinsic reason, apart from the fact that C&aelig;dmon already lived in Whitby, why he could not have received the gift of song at any other monastery or under any other abbess. Bede does not mention Hild or even Strean&aelig;shalch by name in the chapter, and, while the poet&rsquo;s career is often held by modern scholars to represent one of the highlights of her abbacy (e.g. &lapidgeetal2001;, <title level="a">Hild</title>), C&aelig;dmon does not receive a mention in Bede&rsquo;s earlier account of Whitby under Hild&rsquo;s stewardship in IV. 23.</p>
       <p id="CH1.180" n="1.19">In the case of the stories of Imma&rsquo;s bonds and C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s &hymn;, the principal difference between the two stories lies in the nature of the main characters&rsquo; miracles and the way in which, in his chapter on Imma, Bede attempts to tie his character&rsquo;s experiences into the main narrative of the &he;.<note id="CH1.NOTE.120" n="7"><p>Lerer argues that the C&aelig;dmon and Imma episodes show an essential similarity in their portrayal of the appropriation of a Germanic pagan (and oral) past by a Christian (and largely literary) present (&lerer1991;, chapter 1). The two stories differ, however, in that Bede appears to see C&aelig;dmon as being far more revolutionary. As Lerer demonstrates, Imma&rsquo;s story is largely about the replacement of pagan magic with a functional Christian equivalent: the story shows that the sacrifice of the mass can release temporal and spiritual bonds at least as effectively as pagan charms. In C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story, on the other hand, Bede depicts the creation of an entirely new type of poetry by an entirely new type of poet. As discussed below (&sect;&nbsp;&ch1r340;), Bede contrasts C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s oeuvre, methods of composition, performance, and training with that of the secular poets of the <foreign lang="LAT">conuiuium</foreign> at every possible juncture. Unlike Aldhelm, moreover, who is said by William of Malmesbury to have disguised himself as a (secular) minstrel in order to lure his parishioners back to church (see below, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch2x180;-&ch2x200;), C&aelig;dmon does not attempt to replace his colleagues&rsquo; music with a Christian equivalent: &ch; is not a text for performance in a Christian <foreign lang="ANG">gebeorscipe</foreign>. Lerer&rsquo;s argument does work well if we consider the poem apart from Bede&rsquo;s account: as argued below, &ch3x;, &ch; appears, in practice, to be a very traditional Germanic poem.</p></note> In C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story, as we have seen, the actual wonder of the poet&rsquo;s inspiration and initial performance plays a relatively minor role in the events of the chapter as a whole. Bede refers to the dream only as it occurs in the story&rsquo;s narrative and he attributes little or none of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s later success as a propagandist to direct audience knowledge of his dream vision or initial song. Imma&rsquo;s story, on the other hand, is far more <emph>about</emph> the main character&rsquo;s miracle: Imma is released from his bonds on more than one occasion and a considerable amount of narrative space is devoted to speculation as to why he cannot be shackled. Just as importantly, Bede himself is much more explicit in accounting for the significance of the wonder he relates. He begins the chapter on Imma by stating that he believes the account <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0190">should certainly not be passed over in silence, since the story may lead to the salvation of many</quote> (<quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0190" lang="LAT">nequaquam silentio praetereundum arbitror, sed multorum saluti, si referatur, fore proficuum</quote>). Destroying the suspense inherent in his narrative, moreover, he goes on to tell us twice about the miracle&rsquo;s significance as a demonstration of the efficacy of the mass even before Imma returns to his brother and discovers the real cause of his freedom: first in his own voice, noting that no one could bind Imma <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0200" lang="LAT">quarum celebratione</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0200">on account of the celebration of these [masses],</quote> and subsequently, when Imma is questioned by his first captor, in that of the captive himself, who immediately and correctly guesses the solution to the puzzle:</p>
       <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0210" lang="LAT">
	<p><q>Sed habeo fratrem</q> inquit <q>presbyterum in mea prouincia, et scio quia ille me interfectum putans pro me missas crebras facit; et si nunc in alia uita essem, ibi anima mea per intercessiones eius solueretur a poenis.</q></p>

       <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0210">
	<p><q>However,</q> said he, <q>I have a brother in my country who is a priest and I know he believes me to be dead and offers frequent masses on my behalf; so if I had now been in another world, my soul would have been loosed from its punishment by his intercessions.</q></p>
       </quote>	
       <p id="CH1.190" n="1.20">To make sure the point is not lost, moreover, Bede concludes the narrative section of the chapter with one more explicit discussion of what has happened and why it is important: when Imma returns and compares stories with his brother he discovers not only that he was correct about the correspondence between the release of his bonds and his brother&rsquo;s masses, but also that <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0220" lang="LAT">alia, quae periclitanti ei commoda contigissent et prospera, per intercessionem fraternam et oblationem hostiae salutaris caelitus sibi fuisse donata</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0220">the other comforts and blessings which he had experienced during his time of danger had been bestowed by heaven, through the intercession of his brother and the offering up of the saving Victim.</quote> At the chapter&rsquo;s end, finally, Bede returns to his rationale for including the story in the &he;, commenting on its reliability and necessity (see &lerer1991;, 39-40):</p>
       <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0230" lang="LAT">

     <head id="CH1.3.HEAD">C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s career as literary history</head>
     <p id="CH1.200" n="1.21">If Bede&rsquo;s chapter on C&aelig;dmon is unusual for the relative lack of attention it pays to the apparent wonder by which the poet came by his gift, it is just as unusual for the amount of space it devotes to describing the rest of his life, career, and oeuvre. IV. 24 is an instalment in the literary history of Anglo-Saxon England, rather than, primarily at least, the history of the establishment of the English church. The two histories are related in as much as C&aelig;dmon is a religious poet and his story takes place at Hild&rsquo;s abbey. But Bede&rsquo;s preference for the biographical, literary, and aesthetic details of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s oeuvre over the sacramental or institutional implications of his vision ensures that the chapter remains generically distinct.<note id="CH1.NOTE.130" n="8"><p>Several scholars have argued that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story, in as much as it can be understood as recounting the establishment of a school of religious vernacular verse, does in fact involve an essential episode of the establishment of the church, since such verse would presumably serve as an important tool in the instruction and conversion of illiterate Anglo-Saxons (see in particular &hunterblair1985;, 24-25; &fell1981;, 98-99). While this may or may not be true in fact (there are simply too few authentic accounts of the reception of vernacular verse for us to know much about how it was used), Bede makes no such claim for C&aelig;dmon in the &he;. As Dumville and Kane have pointed out, Bede does not claim that C&aelig;dmon was the first to compose religious verse in English (&dumville1981;, 148; &kane1948;, 251-252), and he gives no indication that he passed on his skills with any success to subsequent generations of poets, none of whom, we are told, <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0240" lang="LAT">eum aequiperare potuit</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0240">could compare with him.</quote> Furthermore, while Bede does show how C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse helped turn the minds of his audiences to divine concerns, he never suggests the poet had any more than a local effect: he makes no claim that men&rsquo;s hearts still are turned to God through the performance of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s songs, and he does not suggest that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s fame or work spread far beyond Hild&rsquo;s abbey. This failure to stress C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s popularity with future generations or outside Strean&aelig;shalch contrasts with the perhaps spurious claims made about the broad dissemination of (lost) poetry by Aldhelm and Alfred in accounts by William of Malmesbury; it also sets Bede&rsquo;s account apart from other commonly cited <socalled>analogues</socalled> (&ch2x;).</p></note> In this one instance, Bede gives modern scholars of Anglo-Saxon literature what they most lack from the period: an approximately contemporary account of literary life in Anglo-Saxon England written by somebody who, if we are to believe the claims of his student Cuthbert (see below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1r250;), was himself well trained in the vernacular poetic tradition. No comparable non-fiction account of Anglo-Saxon literary life survives from the entire period.</p>
     <p id="CH1.210" n="1.22">Indeed, it is hard to overestimate how unusual Bede&rsquo;s account is as a literary document. From a vernacular tradition spanning nearly half a millennium, literary history records the names of no more than a dozen Old English poets: &AElig;duwen, Aldhelm, Alfred, Anlaf, Baldulf, Bede, C&aelig;dmon, Cnut, Cynewulf, Dunstan, Hereward, and Wulfstan (or perhaps Wulfsige).<note id="CH1.NOTE.135" n="9"><p>No specific study of named poets in Anglo-Saxon England seems to exist. This list has been compiled from material in &frank1993;, esp. 29-31, and nn. 100 and 101; &opland1980;; &robinsonfc1990;, 61; and &sisamk1953;, 225-231.</p></note> Of these, most are almost certainly spurious. Later English writers, particularly those of the twelfth century, seem to have developed quite a taste for discovering the names of traditional Anglo-Saxon poets (see esp. &frank1993;, 30-35). Thus it is from Geoffrey of Monmouth that we know the name of the monk Baldulf, a vernacular poet of whom no trace otherwise survives (<title level="m">Historia regum</title> [ed. &wrightandcrick1985-1991;], &sect;&nbsp;143, 101). From a similar source, the <title level="m">Liber Eliensis</title> (ed. &blakeeo1962;), we learn of the poetic activity of the Anglo-Saxon King Cnut, although the text this source attributes to him is not in a recognisable Old English metre and seems unlikely to have been composed by him (see &opland1980;, 188-189). Other names attached to vernacular poetic activity in the twelfth century, apparently for the first time, include Saints Aldhelm and Dunstan,<note id="CH1.NOTE.170" n="10"><p>Although references to Dunstan&rsquo;s musical ability appear much earlier, Eadmer&rsquo;s <title level="m">Life</title> appears to contain the first reference specifically to vernacular song (see &opland1980;, 179; &frank1993;, 31, n. 100). Dunstan was accused of singing heathen songs, charms, and <socalled>histories</socalled> by his enemies in King Athelstan&rsquo;s courts according to the eleventh-century <socalled>Auctor B</socalled> (&sect;&nbsp;6 [ed. &stubbs1874;]), however; these were presumably also in the vernacular (see &opland1980;, 178-179).</p></note> Anlaf, and Hereward (William of Malmesbury, <title level="m">De gestis pontificum Anglorum</title> [ed. &hamilton1870;], V. 190 [Aldhelm] and II. 131 [Anlaf]; Eadmer, <title level="m">Vita sancti Dunstani</title> [ed. &stubbs1874;], ch. 4; <title level="m">Gesta Herwardi</title> [ed. &hardyandmartin1966;], 2: 351).</p>
     <p id="CH1.220" n="1.23">For a few other named poets, evidence that they actually composed vernacular verse is a bit stronger. A few Old English poems contain internal clues to the identity of their authors. The most famous of these, of course, are the four texts from the Exeter and Vercelli Books that preserve Cynewulf&rsquo;s runic <socalled>signature.</socalled> A fifth internal attribution may be found in a metrical runic inscription on a small brooch found on Ely, in which a certain &AElig;duwen is identified as the ornament&rsquo;s owner in a way that suggests she also might have composed the inscription.<note id="CH1.NOTE.190" n="11"><p>See &robinsonfc1990;, 61, for a hesitant suggestion that &AElig;duwen may have composed the poem. &stanley1987a;, 404-408, discusses the inscription&rsquo;s odd formulation, which, he suggests, makes it unlikely to be a presentation poem. The brooch is described in &okasha1971;, art. 114.</p></note> In neither case do we know very much about these poets other than their names and the identity of their signed works. A sixth example is a verse preface to the Old English translation of <title level="m">Gregory&rsquo;s Dialogues</title> preserved in <label rend="shelfmark">British Library, Cotton Otho C. i</label>, in which Wulfstan is identified as the bishop responsible for commissioning the volume as a whole and it is suggested that he may have been responsible for the composition of the preface itself (&sisamk1953;, 225-231). Unfortunately, however, this last attribution is certainly incorrect: Wulfstan&rsquo;s name is written over an erasure (&sisamk1953;, 225), and the implicit date of the poem&rsquo;s original composition (it mentions King Alfred in the present tense) rules out any known bishop by that name (see esp. &sisamk1953;, 226).<note id="CH1.NOTE.200" n="12"><p>If, as Sisam suggests, <mentioned lang="ANG">Wulfstan</mentioned> is written over <mentioned lang="ANG">Wulfsige</mentioned>, then we may have a fourth attribution tying a known Anglo-Saxon to a surviving poem (the other three are discussed below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1r250;). Wulfsige, bishop of Sherborne, was Alfred&rsquo;s contemporary and a recipient of his translation of the <title level="m">Cura pastoralis</title> (see &sisamk1953;, 145, 226). Although historical evidence seems to favour Sisam&rsquo;s conclusion (Sisam reports that Wulfsige and Wulfstan are the only two names beginning with <mentioned lang="ANG">Wulfs</mentioned>- in Anglo-Saxon bishop lists), the palaeographic evidence is inconclusive: as Sisam notes, the erasure has removed all trace of the original letters (&sisamk1953;, 225-226; see also &ker1990;, art. 182, who nevertheless considers Sisam&rsquo;s inference to be <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0250">no doubt</quote> correct; &dobbie1942; is slightly more sceptical: see cxvi).</p></note></p>
     <p id="CH1.230" n="1.24">This leaves us with three poets from the entire Anglo-Saxon period for whom we know something specific about their work and biography: King Alfred, to whom the metrical translation of Boethius&rsquo;s <title level="m">Metres</title> is attributed in two prefatory texts; Saint Bede, to whom the Old English poem &BDS; may be attributed in a letter describing his last days; and the herdsman C&aelig;dmon. In the case of the first two, these attributions should come as no surprise. Bede and Alfred were prominent Anglo-Saxons, well known to their own and subsequent generations for both their literary significance and their accomplishments in other fields, and not shy about discussing their own literary endeavours<note id="CH1.NOTE.210" n="13"><p>Alfred discusses his translation policy in his <title level="m">Preface to Gregory</title> (most recently ed. &mitchellandrobinsonfc2001;, 204-207); Bede discusses his literary output in the &he;&rsquo;s concluding chapter (V. 24). Neither claims to be a vernacular poet.</p></note>; both were the type of dynamic figure we might expect to attract attention from later biographers and historians. The real surprise, indeed, is how few and, in the case of Bede at least, how hesitantly the surviving attributions are made. Despite Alfred&rsquo;s well-documented and life-long interest in vernacular poetry, no composition apart from the <title level="m">Metres</title> is attributed to him in contemporary sources.<note id="CH1.NOTE.220" n="14"><p>As Frank notes, the tradition of Alfred as the <socalled>Minstrel King</socalled> has its origins in William of Malmesbury. Asser&rsquo;s contemporary biography of Alfred portrays the king as having a <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0260">fondness for vernacular poetry, but only as a reader and memorizer; never as an oral singer or frequenter of bards</quote> (&frank1993;, 20). The attribution of the verse paraphrase of the <title level="m">Metres</title> to Alfred rests primarily on internal evidence from prefaces found in <label rend="shelfmark">Oxford, Bodleian Library, Bodley 180</label> (prose) and <label rend="shelfmark">London, British Library, Cotton Otho A. vi</label> (prose and verse). A detailed discussion of the prefaces as evidence of Alfred&rsquo;s authorship can be found in &sisamk1953;, 293-297.</p></note> Bede&rsquo;s work as a vernacular poet is even more tenuously attested: the sole contemporary reference comes in a letter by Bede&rsquo;s disciple Cuthbert (ed. and trans. &colgraveandmynors1969;) describing the master&rsquo;s last days, in which he records that Bede uttered five lines of a vernacular poem known to modern scholars as &BDS;<note id="CH1.NOTE.240" n="15"><p>The following translation has been modified slightly to reflect more closely the syntax of the underlying Latin.</p></note>:</p>

     <p rend="noindent">As Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a finite verb to describe Bede&rsquo;s presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert&rsquo;s description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from sacred scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts (see &opland1980;, 140-141). On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert&rsquo;s Latin letter, the observation that Bede <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0300">was learned in our song,</quote> and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all seem to suggest that his connection to the vernacular poem was stronger than mere quotation. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to be implying that its specific wording was in some way important, either as a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who generally appears to have frowned upon secular entertainment (see &mccready1994;, esp. 14-19) or as a direct quotation of Bede&rsquo;s final original composition (see &opland1980;, 140-141, for a discussion of some of the implications of this passage).</p>
     <p id="CH1.240" n="1.25">The fact that Cuthbert&rsquo;s reference to &BDS; and the attribution of the verse translation of the <title level="m">Metres of Boethius</title> to Alfred in proems to the prose and verse texts&mdash;documents that do little more than connect a known historical figure to the composition or performance of a documented poem&mdash;provide us with our second and third most detailed contemporary non-fiction accounts of vernacular poetic production and reception in Anglo-Saxon England says something about the paucity of the surviving records. But Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration is exceptional not only for its length and detail. It is also set apart by the nature of its subject. For C&aelig;dmon, unlike Alfred and Bede, is known primarily because he could sing. No trace of the herdsman&rsquo;s story is found in any other document surviving from the Anglo-Saxon period.<note id="CH1.NOTE.250" n="17"><p>The only possibly pre-twelfth-century allusion to C&aelig;dmon known outside of Bede is found in the prose and verse prefaces associated with the Old Saxon <title level="m">Heliand</title> poem (see &ch2xAppendix;). These texts, which are known only from a sixteenth-century source and do not mention the <title level="m">Heliand</title> itself directly, do not mention C&aelig;dmon by name. The connection lies in the similarities between the life of the poet of the Saxon poem to which they refer and the Whitby herdsman.</p></note> His name is unattested outside of Bede&rsquo;s &historia; and its Old English translation. Even within the &he;, C&aelig;dmon is not named until the moment he is asked to sing by his dream-interlocutor (see &lerer1991;, 43-44). In addition to providing us with an unparalleled amount of information about the life, work, and reception of an approximately contemporary poet, Bede also provides us with an account of an unparalleled type of poet: one whose claim to our attention lies almost exclusively in his skill at composition and his significant position (in his biographer&rsquo;s opinion) in vernacular literary history.</p>
     <p id="CH1.250" n="1.26">There is, moreover, some structural evidence to suggest that this essentially literary interest in C&aelig;dmon was deliberate. For just as it can be shown that the <socalled>miracle</socalled> of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration is not the primary focus of Bede&rsquo;s chapter, so too is it possible to show that the artistry and impact of his poetry is. In order to see this, however, it is first necessary to consider just how unusual a life C&aelig;dmon led. For C&aelig;dmon was privileged to experience not one but two potential miracles in the course of his life: the first, as we have seen, was his gift of poetic inspiration. The second, as Wieland points out, was his apparent foreknowledge of impending death (&wieland1984;, 198).<note id="CH1.NOTE.260" n="18"><p>Wieland sees the <quote>gift of poetry</quote>&mdash;by which he seems to mean C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s continuing ability to compose&mdash;as a third miracle, distinct from his initial vision (&wieland1984;, 198). Bede is far more hesitant than Wieland implies about asserting the hagiographic implications of his story, however. See below, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1r390;.</p></note> As Colgrave suggests, such foreknowledge is a common feature of hagiographic narratives, where it serves as a special dispensation to allow saints who receive it to prepare for their deaths (&colgrave1966;, 213). The miracle was also a favourite of Bede&rsquo;s own hagiographic writing, appearing in both saints&rsquo; stories told in the &he; and in other more exclusively hagiographic works (&colgrave1966;, 211-214). As we shall see (&sect;&nbsp;&ch1r390;), indeed, Cuthbert implies in his letter describing Bede&rsquo;s last days that the master himself had a similar premonition.</p>
     <p id="CH1.260" n="1.27">This second miracle is significant because we find no reference to it, or its potentially saintly implications, at the beginning of Bede&rsquo;s chapter. Instead of describing C&aelig;dmon as a saintly man who learned how to compose wonderful songs, became a zealous monk, and foresaw the end of his life, Bede instead describes him as a great singer who was a good and pious man&mdash;ignoring entirely his apparently saintly end and concentrating exclusively on the beauty of his poetry, his position as the premier vernacular religious poet of his day, and his success as a religious propagandist:</p>

      <p>In the monastery of this abbess there was a certain brother who was specially marked out by the grace of God, so that he used to compose godly and religious songs; thus, whatever he learned from the holy Scriptures by means of interpreters, he quickly turned into extremely delightful and moving poetry, in English, which was his own tongue. By his songs the minds of many were often inspired to despise the world and to long for the heavenly life. It is true that after him other Englishmen attempted to compose religious poems, but none could compare with him. For he did not learn the art of poetry from men nor through a man but he received the gift of song freely by the grace of God. Hence he could never compose any foolish or trivial poem but only those which were concerned with devotion and so were fitting for his devout tongue to utter. He had lived in the secular habit until he was well advanced in years and had never learned any songs.</p>
     </quote>
     <p rend="noindent">While there is much in the actual details of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s life that could be understood as suggesting that he was much more than a good poet and pious monk, Bede does not exploit this aspect of his material: he downplays the importance of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s vision in describing his success as a propagandist, and he largely ignores the evidence of saintliness implicit in his final foreknowledge of death. For Bede, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s primary significance was as a poet, not as a saint: the origins of his gift and the holiness of his life were all secondary to the beauty and power of his verse.</p>

     <head id="CH1.4.HEAD">Bede&rsquo;s account as Christian propaganda</head>
     <p id="CH1.270" n="1.28">The suggestion that Bede&rsquo;s account of C&aelig;dmon is different from other wonder tales in the &he; and, apparently, focuses more on describing a moment in the literary than ecclesiastical history of Britain does not necessarily mean that it is any more or less reliable as a source of factual information about how Anglo-Saxon poets worked or were received. Modern readers still find it difficult to accept that a poet can learn to compose traditional verse overnight at the command of a dream visitor and Bede&rsquo;s account, even if it is unusual for the &he; in its concentration on the practice of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s art over the wonder of his inspiration, nevertheless still appears in a work of church history written by a prominent religious scholar and historian: we would hardly expect to find him including a chapter on the life and work of the &Beo; or &Deor; poets after all, and it is difficult to forget that Bede would have had a doctrinal stake in promoting the work of the Whitby herdsman. His praise for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry, his depiction of the reactions of the abbess and her counsellors, even his presentation of C&aelig;dmon as a poet taught not by men but by the grace of God may all have been influenced, consciously or unconsciously, as much or more by his support for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s goals as by any real knowledge of how the poet learned to sing, his subsequent methods of composition, the extent of his oeuvre, or perhaps even the real aesthetic quality of his verse. Given the generally low opinion of the poem held by modern scholars,<note id="CH1.NOTE.270" n="19"><p>See &morland1992;, 347, n. 18, for a discussion of modern opinion of the &hymn;&rsquo;s aesthetic qualities; Morland reports that she <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0320">cannot find any printed praise of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s &hymn; before that of... [&wrenn1946;], who may have shocked the audience of his Israel Gollancz Memorial Lecture when he declared that <quote>the more one reads it and allows it to become assimilated in one&rsquo;s mind, the more one feels it has qualities of balanced and rhythmic grandeur which still have some poetic appeal</quote>.</quote></p></note> indeed, it is even possible that Bede&rsquo;s account represents simply wishful thinking&mdash;an attempt to claim that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry is as good, as important, and as unusual as Bede wished it were. Even if Bede set out on this one occasion to write what best can be described as an ancestor to the literary biography, his account may be so ideologically, historically, and theologically bound as to prevent us from learning very much from him about his subject.</p>
     <p id="CH1.280" n="1.29">Demonstrating Bede&rsquo;s biases in recording the C&aelig;dmon story has been the focus of a persistent trend in Anglo-Saxon studies. Since Palgrave in the early 1830s first used the existence of supposed analogues to Bede&rsquo;s chapter in biblical, classical and other Germanic literatures to call the authenticity of the C&aelig;dmon story into doubt (&palgrave1832;),<note id="CH1.NOTE.280" n="20"><p>As noted below, &sect;&sect;&nbsp;&ch2x040;-&ch2x090;, the analogue evidence collected by Palgrave and others is far less compelling than is usually claimed. See also &lester1974;.</p></note> numerous scholars have suggested that Bede&rsquo;s version of the story must be in some way more or less deliberately false&mdash;by arguing that he either created his central character out of whole cloth (&palgrave1832;; &ohare1992;), or, in casting the story as a wonder, failed to acknowledge other evidence of the poet&rsquo;s previous literacy and training in Christian exegetical teachings (&fritz1969;; &fritz1974;) or debts to pre-Christian Germanic or Celtic poetic tradition (e.g. &morland1992;, 341-342; &kleiner1988;; &orton1983;, 169; &magoun1955;).</p>
     <p id="CH1.290" n="1.30">That Bede&rsquo;s praise for C&aelig;dmon is at least partially doctrinal is suggested in part by his otherwise well-known opposition to the enjoyment of secular culture for its own sake. In his commentary on 1 Sam xiv (ed. &hurst1962;), in which Jonathan inadvertently disobeys Saul&rsquo;s injunction to fast by dipping his stick into a honeycomb and tasting, Bede both criticises Christians who read pagan literature for mere pleasure and praises those whose knowledge of secular letters allows them to become more effective preachers (&ray1987;, esp. 2-4). In an allusion to Jerome&rsquo;s <title level="m">Epistle</title> xxii&mdash;in which Jerome reports on a dream in which Christ scourged him for being more Ciceronian than Christian in his literary taste&mdash;Bede points out the ease with which even the greatest doctors of the church can fall into the sin of reading secular literature primarily for its own sake (lines 2173-2179; discussed in &ray1987;, 2-3). He follows this criticism of Jerome, however, with an endorsement of Jonathan&rsquo;s breaking the fast, by arguing that his behaviour is justified by the practice of Moses and Daniel and can serve as a model for those who are able to use pagan rhetoric in the service of religion (lines 2222-2236; trans. &ray1987;, 4):</p>

     <p id="CH1.300" n="1.31">In other contexts, Bede also devotes considerable attention to demonstrating the superiority (and at times the priority) of Christian writings over classical pagan rhetoric (&mccready1994;, 12-14).

     <p id="CH1.310" n="1.32">In the case of his account of C&aelig;dmon and his poetry, this partisan interest may show up in both the terms Bede uses to praise C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse and the attention he devotes to showing how C&aelig;dmon learned to sing <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0350" lang="LAT">non ab hominibus neque per hominem... sed diuinitus adiutus gratis...</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0350">not... from men nor through a man, but... freely by the grace of God.</quote> In describing C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry as <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0360" lang="LAT">carmen dulcissimum</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0360">most melodious verse,</quote> and in praising it for its use of <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0370" lang="LAT">uerbis poeticis maxima suauitate,</quote> <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0370">extremely delightful and moving poetry,</quote> Bede calls to mind his commentary on 1 Sam xiv, in which the same terms are used to describe both the temptation and rewards offered Christian teachers by pagan rhetoric (lines 2143-2164; trans.

This reading instructs, as it were, teachers of truth to abstain from the other allurements of the world, yes even from seeking the sweetness of secular eloquence, and also from destroying those whom they instruct in the rock of the faith by every corruption of a former life. Saul therefore adjured the people pursuing the fleeing Philistines that no one who, fearing the law, abstained diligently both from bread and the honey he saw flowing in the forest should eat bread unless the victory over the enemy had been completed... For whether the flesh strives against the spirit and the spirit strives against the flesh, or the heretic speaks against the catholic or Jew or gentile speaks against the christian or any unclean spirit resists, all the endeavours of temptations are better overcome by the diligence of continence whose virtue extends so widely that it is fitting to abstain even from loving excessively and pursuing the pleasantness of secular eloquence from which the arrogant and uncultivated philosopher arises like a forest.</p>

     <p id="CH1.320" n="1.33">The same partisanship may also influence Bede&rsquo;s treatment of C&aelig;dmon as a poet untouched by native tradition. Although, as we shall see below (&ch3x;), &ch; is, formally speaking, a profoundly Germanic poem, Bede&rsquo;s discussion of the poet&rsquo;s methods of performance and composition establish the herdsman poet as what we might describe as an <socalled>anti-guslar</socalled>: a poet whose training, performance, and career is contrasted at almost every point with those of the presumably traditional and secular singers he abandons at the <foreign lang="LAT">conuiuium</foreign>. The opening lines of Bede&rsquo;s chapter establish both that C&aelig;dmon had never learned any songs before his dream vision and that he could not sing songs of pure entertainment even after his encounter with his dream visitor. C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s subsequent career, likewise, is implicitly contrasted with that of traditional singers at almost every stage (&frantzen1990;, 139-144; &kleiner1988;). While modern scholarship in oral and traditional verse performance suggests that poets learn their craft while young men by listening to more experienced and accomplished singers (see &lord2000;), C&aelig;dmon is said to have been an old man who habitually left festivities when singing began in order to avoid being called upon to perform. For C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s fellows, the singing of songs is a pleasant social event: they perform inside on joyful occasions, accompanied by the harp, and take turns singing to an audience made up of their peers. For C&aelig;dmon, however, poetry is a solitary obligation: he receives his inspiration outside after he leaves the hall in which his colleagues are feasting; he is commanded to sing by an apparently otherworldly visitor who neither accepts his first refusal nor asks for a song after first singing something himself; and he performs without instrumental accompaniment to an audience consisting solely of his interlocutor and, presumably, the animals he was watching over that night. C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s training, moreover, as Fritz and others have pointed out, resembles not so much that accorded a traditional vernacular poet as a monk destined to become a scriptural exegete (&fritz1974;; &irvine1994;, esp. 433; &schrader1980;, esp. 66-68; &lerer1991;, 33): instead of being given additional practice in the art of his native tradition, C&aelig;dmon is instead taught scripture, patristics, and church history, a training which, as Fritz and Day have demonstrated, produces a corpus of verse almost exactly in keeping with that prescribed by Augustine for religious scholars and Latin poets (&fritz1969;, 335-336; &day1975;, 54-55). In suggesting that C&aelig;dmon was a better poet than his contemporaries, Bede emphasises the differences between his and their careers, training, methods of composition, and performance. Given his interest in demonstrating the superiority of Christian literature over its pagan counterpart, it is entirely possible that Bede in this case allows his desire to influence the details of the story he tells.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 id="CH1.5">
     <head id="CH1.5.HEAD">Did Bede believe C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story?</head>
     <p id="CH1.330" n="1.34">Taken together, this evidence suggests that Bede was more interested in C&aelig;dmon as a poet of the English language than as a saint of the English church, and that he had a strong interest in demonstrating the superiority and independence of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s verse from previous vernacular tradition. But proving that Bede had a partisan interest in promoting C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s uniqueness, artistic skill, and value as a propagandist is not the same thing as demonstrating that he made up or consciously distorted his evidence for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s reputation, quality, or methods of composition. Bede was a pious man who believed that God could directly intervene in the affairs of men. His predilection for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry, though ideologically convenient, is also perfectly in keeping with the taste for religious orthodoxy demonstrated in his own Latin poetry, and, even if he did not actually compose it, his performance of the <title level="m">Death Song</title> from his death bed. The fact that it was handy for Bede to believe that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry was of such exceptional quality does not mean that he actually considered the Whitby herdsman to be a poor poet, or thought that Hild and her scholars did not set C&aelig;dmon to composing the rest of his now lost body of religious verse. Certainly the rest of the Anglo-Saxon poetic corpus, in which pagan works are essentially absent and even secular poems dealing with religious themes such as &Beo; are outnumbered by explicitly pious texts like &SoulSR;, &Phoen;, and &Pr;, suggests that more than one Anglo-Saxon agreed with Bede in his estimation as to what made for good Old English verse.</p>
     <p id="CH1.340" n="1.35">The same is also true of the <socalled>miracle</socalled> of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration. Bede believed in miracles, but had a different understanding of what a miracle was. Where we tend to see miracles as being a technical explanation of last resort, as a means of explaining events that cannot be accounted for in any non-supernatural way, Bede saw them as a way of explaining why things happen, whether or not their causes can be explained on non-supernatural grounds (&ward1976;, 71; &mccready1994;, esp. 25-43). The &he; is full of <socalled>miraculous</socalled> events that are open to rational explanation&mdash;from fires that burn down monasteries, to sudden changes in the wind that keep saints&rsquo; disciples on islands (examples are collected and discussed in &mccready1994;, 25-43). Even phenomena that Bede in his scientific writing is able to attribute to natural rather than divine causes assume a divine tincture in the &he; when their occurrence warrants the interpretation that they are part of God&rsquo;s plan. For Bede, calling something a miracle is an act of interpretation, not an attempt at explanation.</p>
     <p id="CH1.350" n="1.36">Moreover Bede does not always assume a miracle is at work, even when he describes phenomena for which no rational explanation appears to be possible. Although it is rare in the &he;, Bede occasionally reports <socalled>facts</socalled> of natural history that, to our eyes at least, simply cannot be true. Bede&rsquo;s depiction of the British Isles in I. 1, for example, contains the following famous description of Ireland:</p>
     <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0410" lang="LAT">
      <p>Hibernia autem et latitudine sui status et salubritate ac serenitate aerum multum Brittaniae praestat, ita ut raro ibi nix plus quam triduana remaneat; nemo propter hiemem aut faena secet aestate aut stabula fabricet iumentis; nullum ibi reptile uideri soleat, nullus uiuere serpens ualeat. Nam saepe illo de Brittania adlati serpentes, mox ut proximante terris nauigio odore aeris illius adtacti fuerint, intereunt; quin potius omnia pene quae de eadem insula sunt contra uenenum ualent. Denique uidimus, quibusdam a serpente percussis, rasa folia codicum qui de Hibernia fuerant, et ipsam rasuram aquae inmissam ac potui datam talibus protinus totam uim ueneni grassantis, totum inflati corporis absumsisse ac sedasse tumorem.</p>
     </quote>
     <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0410">
      <p>Ireland is broader than Britain, is healthier and has a much milder climate, so that snow rarely lasts there for more than three days. Hay is never cut in summer for winter use nor are stables built for their beasts. No reptile is found there nor could a serpent survive; for although serpents have often been brought from Britain, as soon as the ship approaches land they are affected by the scent of the air and quickly perish. In fact almost everything that the island produces is efficacious against poison. For instance we have seen how, in the case of people suffering from snake-bite, the leaves of manuscripts from Ireland were scraped, and the scrapings put in water and given to the sufferer to drink. These scrapings at once absorbed the whole violence of the spreading poison and assuaged the swelling.</p>
     </quote>
     <p rend="noindent">Here we have a claim that ought to offend our reason more strongly than anything in the C&aelig;dmon episode&mdash;despite the fact that Bede says he has seen this happen himself and doesn&rsquo;t claim that it is a miracle. Bede seems to have thought that the ability to cure snake-bites was an inherent property of medieval Irish manuscripts rather than a demonstration of any particular saint&rsquo;s sanctity or evidence of God&rsquo;s direct intervention in the affairs of men.</p>
     <p id="CH1.360" n="1.37">This is significant in the case of C&aelig;dmon because it suggests that the <socalled>fact</socalled> that the herdsman learned to sing overnight in a way that we on the whole consider to be impossible does not necessarily mean that Bede himself considered the poet&rsquo;s inspiration to be a miracle or that Bede was consciously adapting C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story to emphasise its wondrous aspects. Although his account leaves open the possibility that the Whitby herdsman&rsquo;s career and death were the result of one or more miracles, Bede never argues that they actually were. His chapter&rsquo;s opening lines indicate that he believed that C&aelig;dmon was taught to sing by the grace of God rather than through the agency of men. But Bede never claims in the course of his narrative that the visitor who told C&aelig;dmon to sing actually was an angel. In his description of the dream, Bede refers to the visitor, as we have seen, noncommittally using the indefinite Latin pronoun <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0420" lang="LAT">quidam</quote>. Unlike many other heavenly visitors in the &he;, moreover, this <foreign lang="LAT">quidam</foreign> is not explicitly or even very strongly implicitly portrayed as being otherworldly.<note id="CH1.NOTE.290" n="21"><p>Examples of more explicitly otherworldly visitors in the &he; (drawn from &colgrave1966;, 211-212) include the heavenly choir seen by Chad and Owini (IV. 3); the men in white seen by Earcongota (III. 8); the men in bright garments who visit Sebbi (IV. 11); Wilfrid&rsquo;s vision of the archangel Michael (V. 19); and various deceased acquaintances and saints who return to earth to advise the living (see for example, the visions of the nuns of Barking in IV. 8-9).</p></note> He wears no special clothes (many visitors in the &he; are brightly dressed or wear white), and he does nothing else particularly angelic, in contrast to, for example, the angel who visits Coldingham in the next chapter and who predicts the impending fire after walking around and investigating the resident nuns&rsquo; sinfulness. Indeed, there is nothing in Bede&rsquo;s account to stop us, like Scrooge facing Marley&rsquo;s ghost, from psychologising C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s visitor, deciding that he is <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0425">more of gravy than of the grave,</quote> and attributing his appearance to <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0430">an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato</quote> (<title level="m">A Christmas Carol</title>, Stave 1)&mdash;or perhaps a jug of beer too many at the <foreign lang="LAT">conuiuium</foreign> (see &osborn1989;, 14-15, for this possibility).</p>
     <p id="CH1.370" n="1.38">It is, of course, highly unlikely that Bede would attempt to explain C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s experience in this fashion. Bede believed in supernatural events&mdash;even supernatural events he did not consider to be miraculous&mdash;in a way that most modern scholars do not. But this does not mean that he accepted everything he was told about C&aelig;dmon or shared none of our doubts about the poet&rsquo;s life and death. That Bede was uncertain about the precise nature of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s experience, indeed, is suggested by the reluctant way he treats C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s apparent foreknowledge of his impending death (see above, &sect;&nbsp;&ch1r270;). Just how surprising this reluctance is can be best seen by comparing Bede&rsquo;s unemphatic conclusion to the C&aelig;dmon story to Cuthbert&rsquo;s far more assertive claims about Bede&rsquo;s own last hours. Bede, after recording that C&aelig;dmon asked to be removed to the hospice despite his apparent lack of serious illness and timed his departure so that it coincided with <foreign lang="LAT">nocturn</foreign>, concludes his account by noting that <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0440" lang="LAT">qui etiam praescius sui obitus extitisse ex his quae narrauimus uidetur</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0440">and from what has been said, it would seem that he [i.e. C&aelig;dmon] had foreknowledge of his death.</quote> In contrast, Cuthbert&rsquo;s account of Bede&rsquo;s demise asserts that Bede foresaw the time of his death despite an explicit statement to the contrary from Bede himself. When Bede, quoting Elihu (<title level="m">Job</title> 32:22), tells his disciples to concentrate because he does not know how long he will be with them (<quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0450" lang="LAT">nescio quamdiu subsistam, et si post modicum tollat me Factor meus</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0450">I know not how long I may be with you, nor whether after a short time my Maker may not take me from you</quote>),<note id="CH1.NOTE.301" n="22"><p>As Colgrave and Mynors note, this is the Vulgate text. Modern English translations of the passage have a different sense.</p></note> Cuthbert interrupts the narrative to assert that Bede nevertheless really did seem to have foreknowledge of the hour at which he was to die: <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0460" lang="LAT">Nobis tamen uidebatur, ne forte exitum suum bene sciret</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0460">[b]ut it seemed to us that he knew very well when his end should be.</quote> Elsewhere in Bede&rsquo;s &historia;, the veracity of saints&rsquo; foreknowledge of death is also more vigorously asserted. Thus the death of Chad in IV. 3 is foretold first of all in elaborate detail by the saint himself, and then immediately endorsed by the narrator&rsquo;s own conclusion that <quote id="CH1.QUOTE.0470" lang="LAT">Quod quidem ita ut dictum ei erat opere completum est</quote>, <quote corresp="CH1.QUOTE.0470">[t]his was fulfilled just as he had been told....</quote> Likewise, the veracity of Wilfred&rsquo;s warning that he should die four years after his vision of the archangel Michael at Meaux is accepted without comment in Bede&rsquo;s account of the saint&rsquo;s death in V. 19.</p>
     <p id="CH1.380" n="1.39">It is this apparent hesitation at describing C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration and death as miracles that argues for Bede&rsquo;s belief in the facts of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s story&mdash;or at least the facts as he thought he knew them. Bede clearly believed that C&aelig;dmon had learned to sing overnight in a dream in response to the commands of an unknown interlocutor. He also seems to have thought that C&aelig;dmon composed great poetry and that he might have foreseen the hour of his own death. The trouble Bede appears to have had with the story lies not in its <socalled>facts</socalled> but in what these facts meant: that is, in deciding whether or not these to our minds unlikely incidents indicate that C&aelig;dmon was a saint or had been in direct contact with God or his angels. For us, the question is whether or not we accept the premises of the story as Bede appears to have learned and believed it. If we do, then the question of how this inspiration occurred is something we can only answer by seeking explanatory parallels or rationalisations: perhaps C&aelig;dmon really had learned more songs than Bede was aware of (&morland1992;); perhaps he had some blockage that prevented him from singing (&magoun1955;; &palgrave1831;); perhaps God interferes in literary history more often than modern scholars appreciate.<note id="CH1.NOTE.300" n="23"><p>See also &cavill2002;, who reaches a similar conclusion about the significance of the <socalled>miracle</socalled> from a very different perspective. Cavill&rsquo;s work in this article came to my attention after this chapter was drafted.</p></note> If, as seems more likely, however, we do not accept that C&aelig;dmon really learned to sing overnight, then there is nothing more to be learned about C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s oeuvre or methods of composition from Bede&rsquo;s account. Bede provides us with no evidence to suggest that he knew a more <socalled>rational</socalled> explanation for C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetic ability, and, in as much as he does not claim to have been an eyewitness to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s career or inspiration, there is no point attempting to sift his account for clues as to what <socalled>really</socalled> went on (cf. &palgrave1831;; &magoun1955;; &morland1992;). What we can say is that Bede was impressed by C&aelig;dmon and by the one piece of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry that we can be sure he knew. We can also say that all evidence suggests that Bede is reporting the story of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s inspiration, career, and death as it had been told to him. If we believe the facts of the story must have been otherwise, our quarrel is not with Bede but with those who first embellished the tale he passes on. Unfortunately, we will never know what those people really knew of C&aelig;dmon or, if they changed his story, why they decided to do so. Regardless of the historical truth of Bede&rsquo;s story, the account remains an important source of interpretative information about how C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s song was understood by the period&rsquo;s most significant scholar.</p>
