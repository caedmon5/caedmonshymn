Fonts (/caedmon/html/fonts/readme.txt)

Junicode
The fonts provided in this directory support all characters used in
this edition. Although other fonts on your system may contain most or
all of these characters, the use of Junicode is recommended. This set
of fonts should work on most major operating systems. The Junicode
Font is distributed under the Gnu General Public Licence (GPL). See
gpl.txt in this directory for the licence text.

Installation
Installation of fonts varies from operating system to operating
system. In most cases, it involves copying the font files to a
fonts directory (you can find this by searching your disk for files
ending in the extension .ttf). Some systems also have a utility to
help in the installation process. In Windows, for example, this can be
found in the "Control Panel". Users should consult their user
manuals for precise instructions on font installation.
